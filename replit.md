# LitAgents - Autonomous Literary Agent Orchestration System

## Overview

LitAgents is a Node.js application that orchestrates 4 autonomous AI literary agents using Google's Gemini 3 Pro model with advanced reasoning capabilities. The system manages the complete novel-writing workflow from plot planning to final manuscript production.

The application features:
- **4 Specialized AI Agents**: Architect (plot planning), Ghostwriter (prose writing), Editor (quality auditing), and Copy Editor (style polishing)
- **World Bible System**: Persistent memory for characters, locations, timeline events, and lore rules
- **Thought Signature Logging**: Captures AI reasoning processes for auditing how decisions were made
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Monitors agent status, chapter progress, and console output
- **Refinement Loops**: Automatic rejection and rewriting of chapters that don't meet quality thresholds
- **Imported Manuscripts**: Upload external Word documents in 6 languages (EN, FR, DE, IT, PT, CA), automatically parse chapters, and professionally edit them using the CopyEditor agent with token cost tracking

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom configuration for Replit environment
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state and caching
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theme using CSS variables for light/dark mode
- **Design System**: Microsoft Fluent Design approach - productivity-focused with clear typography hierarchy (Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for logs, Merriweather for manuscripts)

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Pattern**: RESTful endpoints with Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates
- **Agent System**: Modular agent classes extending a BaseAgent abstract class
  - Each agent has specialized system prompts optimized for Gemini 3's reasoning mode
  - Orchestrator manages the pipeline flow between agents
  - Refinement loops (max 3 attempts) allow the Editor agent to reject and trigger rewrites
  - **Critical**: Editor feedback (continuity errors, verisimilitude problems, missing beats, repeated phrases, style violations) is explicitly passed to Ghostwriter during rewrites via `buildRefinementInstructions()`

### Data Storage
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Schema Location**: `shared/schema.ts` contains all table definitions
- **Key Tables**:
  - `projects`: Novel projects with genre, tone, chapter count, and series settings (workType, seriesId, seriesOrder)
  - `chapters`: Individual chapter content with status tracking
  - `worldBibles`: JSON storage for characters, timeline, rules, and plot outlines
  - `thoughtLogs`: AI reasoning signatures for each agent action
  - `agentStatuses`: Real-time status tracking for dashboard display
  - `series`: Groups projects into series/trilogies for continuity
  - `continuitySnapshots`: Stores summaries of completed works for AI continuity (8-12k tokens)
  - `importedManuscripts`: External manuscript uploads with language and status tracking
  - `importedChapters`: Chapters parsed from uploaded manuscripts with original/edited content and token usage

### AI Integration
- **Model**: Gemini 3 Pro Preview via Replit AI Integrations
- **Configuration**: 
  - `thinkingConfig.thinkingBudget: 10000` for deep reasoning
  - `temperature: 1.0` and `topP: 0.95` for creative output
- **Client Setup**: Uses `@google/genai` SDK with Replit's proxy endpoints (no external API key required)

### Build System
- **Development**: `tsx` for TypeScript execution with hot reload
- **Production**: esbuild bundles server code, Vite builds client assets
- **Output**: Combined into `dist/` directory with static files in `dist/public/`
