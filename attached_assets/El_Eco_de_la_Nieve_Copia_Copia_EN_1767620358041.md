It was a solid mass of ice needles that pierced Isabel's throat, tearing the soft tissue of her lungs with each desperate inhalation. There was no sound in the world, save for the roar of her own blood pounding inside her ears, a frantic, erratic drumming that threatened to burst her eardrums.\n\nShe ran. Or at least, her brain tried to, sending urgent commands to legs that had long since ceased to respond like flesh, behaving instead like waterlogged wood. The white mantle reached her knees, an immaculate and virgin ocean plotting to devour her. Each step demanded lifting a dead weight, breaking the frozen crust of the surface, and sinking into the treacherous powder beneath.\n\nThe forest was a cathedral of shadows. The fir trees, century-old giants laden with winter, leaned over her like silent judges, their branches bowed by the storm's weight. There was no moon. The sky had been swallowed by a mass of clouds so dense it blurred the border between earth and firmament. Only gray, black, and the dirty white of the ground existed, stretching infinitely in all directions.\n\nIsabel stumbled.\n\nIt wasn't a dramatic fall, but a clumsy collapse. Her hands, gloved in cheap wool that no longer protected anything, sank into the icy tapestry, searching for a handhold that didn't exist. The cold bit at her wrists, an icy burn that climbed her forearms like an invisible parasite. She tried to get up, pushing herself with a moan that died, drowned out by the vastness of the valley, but the ground gave way.\n\nThe slope was steeper than her eyes, blinded by frozen tears, had calculated. She rolled. The world became a blender of shadows and blunt impacts. A root hidden beneath the white mantle, hard as wrought iron, trapped her right boot while the rest of her body continued to spin from inertia.\n\nThe snap sounded like a dry branch breaking in the silence of a library.\n\nThe suffering wasn't immediate; first came the nausea, a dizzying wave that blurred her vision, and then, the fire. A liquid fire erupted from her ankle, radiating agonizing cramps that made her arch her back on the icy bed. Isabel's scream tore through the night, but the snow cover, that impassive sponge, absorbed the sound before it could travel more than three meters.\n\nShe lay there, supine, gazing into the unfathomable blackness as the flakes fell upon her face. They were enormous, soft, oblivious to her suffering. They settled on her eyelashes, on her parted lips, melting with the residual heat of her life.\n\n“Please…” she whispered. The word crystallized into a cloud of ephemeral vapor.\n\nNo one answered. Only the wind, whistling through the treetops with an ancient, cruel melody. Isabel tried to crawl. She dug her elbows into the icy mantle, ignoring the protests of her exhausted muscles, and pulled her body forward. Her right leg was a useless burden, an anchor of agony that carved a deep furrow behind her.\n\nShe advanced half a meter. Then another. Her breathing was a broken bellows.\n\nThen, the wind shifted.\n\nIt stopped carrying the scent of resin and damp earth. Suddenly, in the midst of the wild, an impossible scent emerged. It was clinical. Aseptic. A pungent fragrance of mint and hospital disinfectant that had no right to exist in that primordial forest.\n\nIsabel stopped. Instinct, that primitive animal dwelling at the base of the brain, made the hairs on her neck stand on end. The agony in her ankle faded into the background, eclipsed by a far older terror. She turned her head, her neck stiff from the cold, and looked towards the top of the slope she had fallen down.\n\nThere he was.\n\nIt wasn't a monster with sharp teeth, nor a beast of legend. It was a human silhouette, outlined against the faint luminosity reflected by the white shroud. A man. Motionless. The storm whipped at his coat, but he seemed oblivious to the weather's violence. He didn't pant. There was no urgency in his posture. He watched her with the patience of one who observes an hourglass, knowing the last grain is about to fall.\n\nIsabel wanted to scream again, but her throat had closed up, a pipe choked by panic.\n\nThe figure began to descend.\n\nHe wasn't running. He didn't rush with the fury of a hungry predator. His steps were methodical, calculated. He sank his boots into the immaculate tapestry with almost choreographic precision, advancing effortlessly, as if levitating above the disaster. As he drew closer, Isabel could make out disjointed details: an impeccably tailored wool coat, black leather gloves, a face partially hidden by a gray scarf.\n\nWhat terrified her most wasn't that he carried a weapon —his hands appeared empty— but his eyes.\n\nWhen he was close enough for her to see their color, she realized they were two pools of blue ice. There was no anger in them. No feverish glint of lust nor the darkness of hatred. They were empty of human passion, yet filled with a terrible purpose. He looked at her as a sculptor gazes upon a rough block of marble, evaluating veins and fractures.\n\n“No…” Isabel tried to pull back, kicking with her good leg, uselessly throwing snow at him. “Don’t come closer!”\n\nThe man stopped a step away from her. He knelt with fluid elegance, his knees not touching the damp ground. The mint fragrance intensified, enveloping her, suffocating the stench of her own fear.\n\n“Shhh,” the sound was soft, almost maternal.\n\nHe extended a gloved hand. Isabel braced for the blow. She closed her eyes, preparing for the impact that would end everything. But the blow never came. Instead, she felt a delicate touch on her cheek, the cold leather brushing against her fevered skin. He brushed aside a strand of wet hair that had stuck to her forehead with a tenderness that chilled her blood more than the icy environment itself.\n\n“You’ve done very well, Isabel,” he said. His voice was a soft, cultured baritone, without any harshness. “You’ve fought bravely. That’s important. The struggle preserves the vitality of color in the cheeks.”\n\nShe opened her eyes, confused, trembling uncontrollably.\n\n“What…?” she stammered, her teeth chattering.\n\n“But it’s over now. The chaos has ended,” the man slid his hand down, tracing her neck, her shoulder, until it reached her left arm. His movements were those of a veteran doctor, sure and efficient. “Look at your leg. It’s broken. The asymmetry is… regrettable, but correctable. Suffering is disfiguring your expression.”\n\nIsabel tried to pull her arm away, but he held her. He didn't grip with brute force; he merely applied the exact pressure at the precise points to nullify her resistance. With his other hand, he extracted something from the inner pocket of his coat. A metallic case gleamed fleetingly.\n\n“I’m not going to harm you, my dear,” he whispered, bringing his face closer to hers. His breath smelled of nothing, as if his interior were sterilized. “Suffering is vulgar. Fear is transient. I offer you something better.”\n\nA syringe appeared in his palm. The liquid inside was transparent, viscous.\n\n“No! Help!” Isabel gathered what air remained in her lungs, but he had already acted.\n\nWith surgical dexterity, he slid the needle through the layers of clothing, seeking the deltoid muscle with a precision that spoke of infinite practice. The prick was insignificant compared to the agony of her ankle.\n\n“Permanence,” he said as he pressed the plunger. He did it slowly, savoring the moment, ensuring the fluid entered at the correct pace. “I offer you the perfection of stillness.”\n\nIsabel felt the liquid enter her system. It didn't burn. On the contrary, it was as if she had been injected with liquid sun. A golden warmth began to spread from her shoulder, flowing down her arm, rising towards her neck, enveloping her heart.\n\nThe man withdrew the needle and put away the instruments with methodical calm. He gently stroked her face again, wiping away a tear that had frozen on her cheekbone.\n\n“The world is dirty, Isabel. Time corrupts everything. Old age, sickness, oblivion…” He spoke as if revealing the secret of the universe to her. “But not you. You will be immaculate.”\n\nThe throbbing in her ankle began to fade. It didn't disappear; it simply ceased to matter. It felt distant, as if it were happening to someone else miles away. The trees no longer seemed like threatening judges and became benevolent witnesses. The icy bed was no longer cold; it was a down blanket, soft and cozy.\n\nIsabel's eyelids weighed tons. She tried to keep them open, to fix her gaze on those blue ice eyes, but the world was becoming blurry, soft, beautiful.\n\n“Sleep,” he commanded. It wasn’t a suggestion.\n\nIsabel’s breathing slowed. The drumming in her ears faded, replaced by an absolute, perfect silence. Her body relaxed completely, surrendering to gravity and the icy bed. The last sensation she had wasn't fear. It was an absurd, chemical, and artificial gratitude towards that dark angel who had stolen her suffering.\n\nThe Sculptor watched consciousness leave the girl's eyes, leaving behind a glassy, empty gaze, ready to be immortalized. He nodded to himself, satisfied with the blank canvas that destiny had delivered to him.\n\nThe storm raged, covering them both, but he was in no hurry. Art required time. And now, they had all eternity.\n",

## Chapter 1: El Silencio Blanco

Aigüestortes, Catalan Pyrenees
December 20, 2018

Ice possesses a brutal honesty that people lack. It doesn't pretend, doesn't manipulate, and, above all, it doesn't forgive. If you make a mistake in the city, you apologize; if you make one up here, you die. That binary simplicity was the only thing that kept my demons at bay.

I adjusted my ice axe's leash and dug my crampons into the vitrified surface of the north glacier. The sound was a dry crunch, like a bone snapping, which the wind instantly devoured. At three thousand meters up, oxygen is a luxury and silence, a sentence.

I looked at my wrist. Dad's old analog watch read ten twelve. The face was scratched, but the ticking remained constant, a metallic metronome synchronizing my breathing with the mountain. I took off the thermal glove from my left hand for just a few seconds, exposing my skin to the glacial air. The crescent-shaped scar crossing my palm seemed to contract with the cold, an old friend reminding me why I'd traded police interrogations for glaciology.

People lie. Ice strata do not.

"Let's see what you have for me today," I whispered, and my voice sounded alien, small against the white immensity.

I knelt beside the main crevice. My hand drilling equipment rested beside me. My job was to document a slow tragedy: the glacier's retreat. Global warming was flaying the mountain, stripping away the white layer meter by meter, year after year, exposing rocks that hadn't seen the sun in centuries. The earth was vomiting its history.

I inserted the auger. The metal bit into the surface. I turned the crank, aiming to extract a clean core sample. I needed air bubbles trapped decades ago, tiny time capsules that would tell me what the atmosphere was like before the world decided to slowly commit suicide.

I liked this. The order. The predictable chemistry of solid water. Here there were no hidden motives, no psychopaths with God complexes, no victims whose names you had to forget to sleep at night. Here, there was only physics and thermodynamics.

Until the sun shifted its angle.

An unusual glint caught my peripheral attention, about five meters below, on the slope descending towards the lateral moraine. It wasn't the specular gleam of quartz, nor the typical bluish refraction of compressed ice.

It was something matte. Opaque.

I straightened up, feeling my thigh muscles protest the effort. I walked carefully, making sure the steel points of my boots bit firmly before taking the next step. The wind blew from the north, bringing invisible needles seeking any gap between my scarf and my goggles.

As I approached, the chromatic anomaly became more evident. It looked like a pinkish stain buried under a translucent layer about ten centimeters thick.

"Trash," I muttered. Probably some plastic wrapper left by an irresponsible climber in the nineties, that the thaw was now deciding to return.

Professional indignation prompted me to clear the area. I hated to see my sanctuary desecrated by human negligence. I knelt again, this time with the adze of my ice axe.

I tapped gently.
*Clack.*
Shards of ice flew up like broken diamonds.

I tapped again.
*Clack.*

The surface layer gave way. I swept my gloved hand over it to clear away the resulting snow dust. What was exposed wasn't plastic. Nor was it synthetic fabric faded by UV rays.

I froze. The air caught in my throat, refusing to enter or leave.

The texture beneath the remaining ice had pores. It had lines. It had a biological geography that my brain, trained for years in the behavioral analysis unit, recognized before my eyes were willing to accept it.

I cleaned with frenzy, forgetting scientific caution, scraping the surface with the desperation of someone trying to erase a stain that won't come off. The ice, now polished by my glove, became a perfect window, a macabre museum display.

It wasn't trash.

It was a hand.

A human hand, pale, with fingers slightly curled in a gesture of eternal rest, not agony. The nails had a purplish hue, but the skin... the skin was immaculate. Perfectly preserved by the sub-zero temperature.

I fell backward, sliding a couple of meters until my boots arrested the descent. Bile rose in my esophagus, acidic and hot.

No. Not here. Not now.

I had fled to the top of the world to escape death, to avoid looking another corpse in the eye, to avoid asking myself *why*. And yet, the mountain had betrayed me. The glacier, in its retreat, wasn't just releasing gases and rocks. It was releasing secrets.

I forced myself to look again, fighting the tremor that rose from my gut and spread to my fingertips. That hand wasn't alone. It plunged into the darkness of the deep ice, connected to an arm, a shoulder, a body that the mountain had held in a jealous, glacial embrace.

There, beneath my feet, someone was waiting.

And by the position of the fingers, relaxed, almost elegant, I knew with the certainty of old instincts that this hadn't been an accident. The mountain kills with violence; it breaks, tears, and twists. But this... this had an artificial serenity.

The silence of the valley, which only minutes before seemed a balm, suddenly transformed into a silent scream. I was alone. Completely alone with something that shouldn't exist.

I looked at the hand trapped beneath the glass. It seemed to be waving to me from the other side of the mirror, inviting me back to the hell I thought I'd escaped.

## Chapter 2: Ecos de Cristal

CHAPTER 2: Crystal Echoes

Aigüestortes, Vall de Boí
December 20, 2018

The descent from the glacial moraine was not a journey, but a geological escape. Gravity tugged at Elena Vives' boots with the insistence of an anchor seeking the seabed, while the wind howled a warning that only fools would ignore. Every step on the crusted snow was a crunch that reverberated in her spine, a sonic reminder of human fragility before the mountain's indifference.

She drove the Land Rover around the tight bends of the service road, gripping the steering wheel so hard her knuckles turned white. The vehicle's heater roared at full blast, spitting out dry, synthetic air that irritated her nostrils, but the cold she felt had nothing to do with the ambient temperature. It was an internal chill, a seed of ice planted in her stomach an hour ago, up there, where the world lost its colors to become white and blue.

She glanced sideways at the passenger seat. There rested her digital camera, a black, compact object that now weighed more than all her climbing gear. It held the proof. The anomaly. The reason why the tremor in her right hand, the one holding the gear stick, didn't obey the diesel engine's vibration.

Upon reaching the village, normalcy struck her with the violence of a slap. Christmas lights twinkled in stone shop windows, tourists unloaded skis from family cars, and smoke from chimneys drew gray columns against a sky that was starting to darken prematurely. No one knew what the glacier had spat out, nor did they suspect that, just a few vertical kilometers away, the beauty of the landscape concealed a crystal tomb.

Elena parked in front of the local police station, a slate and wood building that tried to blend in with the valley's traditional architecture, though the radio antenna on the roof broke the rustic illusion. She switched off the engine. The sudden silence in the cabin allowed the ticking of her wrist to become audible. She looked down at the analog men's watch, too large for her arm, its leather strap worn by use and time. The hands advanced relentlessly, oblivious to the horror.

“Calculation and evidence,” she murmured to herself, reciting the mantra she had abandoned three years ago.

She rubbed the crescent-shaped scar on her left palm with her thumb, an automatic, almost superstitious gesture, before opening the door and facing the bureaucracy.

The interior of the police station smelled of synthetic pine, old paper, and over-brewed coffee. The thermal contrast fogged her ski goggles, which hung around her neck, forcing her to blink to adjust to the yellowish fluorescent light. It wasn't a modern big-city station; there were no bulletproof windows or metal detectors at the entrance here. Only a varnished wooden counter and, behind it, a man who seemed carved from the same rock as the surrounding mountains.

Lucas Riera looked up from a grease-stained file. His black hair was flecked with premature gray at the temples, as if the snow from outside had decided to make its home there. His deep brown eyes carried that kind of weariness that isn't cured by sleeping, but by forgetting.

“Can I help you?” he asked. His voice was deep, a baritone resonance that filled the small reception area.

Elena approached the counter, ignoring the pang of claustrophobia that always assailed her in enclosed, unfamiliar spaces. She needed logic to be her shield.

“I’m Dr. Elena Vives, a glaciologist from the National Center. I'm conducting a recession study on the north face of the Perdiguero.”

Lucas placed his pen on the desk with deliberate slowness. He observed Elena's technical clothing, the ice axe still hanging from her backpack, and the tension in her jaw.

“I know who you are,” he said, leaning back in his chair. The wood creaked under his weight. “We received notification of your permit last week. Though I didn't expect to see you down here so soon. The big storm isn't supposed to arrive until tomorrow night.”

“I didn’t come down because of the weather.”

Lucas arched an eyebrow, a minimal gesture that denoted a patience trained for dealing with nervous outsiders.

“If it’s about stolen gear, I warn you that during high season it’s difficult to keep track of every hiker who…”

“I’ve found a body.”

The three words dropped into the room with the weight of stones thrown into a still pond. The hum of the refrigerator in the corner seemed to pause for a second. Lucas straightened up, losing that relaxed posture of a rural official. His expression shifted, moving from bored courtesy to professional alert, though tinged with skepticism.

“A body?” he repeated, as if tasting the word. “An alpinist? We’ve had a couple of rescues this season, but no one’s gone missing this week. Perhaps a lone climber who fell…”

“It wasn’t a fall,” Elena interrupted. Her voice sounded metallic, devoid of the emotional inflection one would expect from someone who had just seen a corpse. It was the tone of the forensic pathologist she had been, not the scientist she was. “The position is incorrect. There are no visible contusions on the exposed dermis, nor fractures on the visible extremities. The body isn’t at the foot of a cliff, officer. It’s in the ice.”

Lucas stood up. He was tall, over six feet, and his broad shoulders blocked much of the light coming from the back window. As he moved, Elena noticed a slight irregularity in his gait, an almost imperceptible limp in his right leg that he tried to disguise by shifting his weight to his left. The humidity from the incoming storm must have been affecting his joints.

“In the ice,” he repeated, coming out from behind the counter and approaching her. Now that he was close, Elena could smell stale tobacco on his uniform. “Listen, Doctor. The glacier moves. It expels remains from decades ago. Last year we found a Civil War boot. Sometimes, the thaw brings ancient accidents to light. If it’s as deep as you say…”

“It’s not ancient.”

Elena abruptly took off her backpack and placed it on a plastic chair. Her hands trembled slightly, but her movements were precise. From it, she extracted the camera.

“The clothes are modern. Synthetic fibers, not wool or leather. And the preservation…” Elena swallowed, feeling a rough knot in her throat. “Its condition was anomalous. Ice usually crushes, deforms. The pressure of tons of frozen water crushes bones. This… this seems cured.”

Lucas stared at her for a moment, assessing her sanity. He saw a woman with eyes injected with adrenaline, brown hair plastered to her forehead with dried sweat, and a scar on her hand that she compulsively rubbed. In his experience, city folk tended to exaggerate nature’s brutality. They saw a fox and cried wolf. They saw a deer bone and cried murder.

“Look,” Lucas said, softening his tone, trying to handle the situation like one calms a frightened child. “I understand it’s been a shock. I’ll go up with a team once the storm passes. We’ll formalize the discovery, call the duty judge, and…”

“You’re not listening to me,” Elena hissed. The condescension in the officer’s voice lit an old fuse in her chest, the fury of not being taken seriously when the data was irrefutable. “If you wait for the storm to pass, the snow will cover the crevasse entrance. The barometric pressure will change. We could lose the exact location. I need you to mobilize scientific personnel now. I need a chain of custody.”

“The scientist?” Lucas let out a short, dry, humorless laugh. “Dr. Vives, this is Aigüestortes, not Madrid. ‘The scientist’ is a guy in Lleida who takes three hours to get here if the road is clear. And believe me, with what’s coming from the north, the road won’t be clear for long.”

He turned, ready to return to his desk and bury the matter in a ‘remains discovery’ form until the weather improved. To him, it was a formality. An unfortunate soul claimed by the mountain, now revealed. Tragic, yes, but part of the cycle of that place.

“See for yourself.”

Elena switched on the camera and extended her arm, interposing the digital screen between the officer’s face and his comfortable denial.

Lucas sighed, frustrated by the insistence, and looked down at the small luminous rectangle.

The image was sharp, despite the meager light from the crevasse. The flash had captured the deep, almost black, blue of the ancient ice. And trapped within that glassy matrix, like an insect in amber, was a face.

Lucas’s world stopped.

It wasn't a poetic metaphor. It was a physiological interruption. His breathing hitched, his diaphragm paralyzed by an urgent command from a brain that didn't know how to process the visual input. The sound of the heater, the hum of the refrigerator, the distant traffic… everything vanished, absorbed by the sepulchral silence emanating from that photograph.

The eyes closed. Eyelashes frosted. The skin pale, marble-like, yet disturbingly intact. And that hair… that unruly lock he had so often brushed from a warm, living forehead.

He felt the blood drain from his face, receding to his heels, leaving him with a sensation of vertigo. His large, calloused hands, which had held weapons and cradled children, closed over the edge of the counter, seeking support, because the ground beneath his feet seemed to have turned to liquid.

Elena observed the transformation. She watched the police chief’s mask of authority crack and crumble, revealing something raw and devastated beneath. It wasn’t a professional’s reaction to an anonymous corpse. It wasn’t disgust or forensic curiosity.

It was recognition.

Lucas extended a trembling finger towards the screen, but didn’t quite touch it, as if fearing the cold of the image might burn his skin.

“No…” The sound scraped from his throat, a denial that held no power over reality. “It can’t be.”

He looked up at Elena. His brown eyes, once tired, were now wells of absolute panic. The barrier between them, the distance between the local officer and the foreign scientist, had evaporated, replaced by a terrible gravity that bound them together.

“Who is it?” Elena asked. There was no demand in her voice now, only the cautious softness of one who knows they are stepping on a landmine.

Lucas didn’t answer immediately. He couldn’t. His mind was struggling to reconcile two impossible realities: the woman he had seen buying bread two days ago, smiling with that red scarf she always wore, and the serene, eternal, and dead figure looking at him from the ice.

“Isabel,” he finally whispered. The name broke on his lips. “It’s Isabel.”

Elena’s watch continued to tick away the seconds, indifferent. Tick-tock. Tick-tock. But time in the police station had changed its texture. It was no longer a winter afternoon awaiting a storm. It was the beginning of a nightmare.

Elena slowly withdrew the camera, putting away the image like one holstering a weapon.

“Then it’s not an ancient accident,” she said, and the phrase hung in the charged air, a sentence that closed all exits. “We have to go back up. Before the snow erases her from the map.”

Lucas nodded, though his gaze remained lost in the void where the screen had been. Outside, the wind began to lash at the windows with greater force, making the panes vibrate. The White Beast was coming, and they had just unearthed something far worse than a storm.

## Chapter 3: La Morgue Improvisada

# Literary Style Guide: Javier Castillo

## The Master of Contemporary Psychological Thriller

Javier Castillo has revolutionized the Spanish suspense landscape with a formula that combines the dizzying pace of the American *bestseller* with emotional depth and a fragmented puzzle structure. This guide details the pillars of his style.

### 1. Narrative Architecture: The Temporal Puzzle

Castillo's most recognizable characteristic is the break from linearity. His stories are not told from beginning to end, but are assembled.

#### A. Multilayered Structure

*   **Intertwined Timelines:** The plot is usually divided into at least two or three timeframes (e.g., the distant past of trauma, the recent past of a disappearance, and the present of the investigation).
*   **Precise Headers:** Each chapter must begin with a location and a date.
    *   **Example:** New York, 1998 / Mississippi, 2020.
*   **Puzzle Effect:** Information is dosed in such a way that a revelation in the past explains strange behavior in the present, keeping the reader in a constant state of "reconstruction."

#### B. Pacing and the Cliffhanger

*   **Short Chapters:** Facilitate quick, compulsive reading ("just one more page").
*   **Suspenseful Endings:** Practically all chapters end with an impactful sentence, an unanswered question, or a revelation that changes the perception of what came before.

### 2. Tone and Atmosphere

Castillo builds an atmosphere of melancholic tension. It's not just suspense; it's the weight of accumulated pain.

*   **Textual Cinematography:** Descriptions are conceived as camera shots. The focus is on what the character sees and physically feels (the cold, the racing pulse, the dim light).
*   **Aesthetic "Americanization":** Setting his works in the U.S. (especially the East Coast or the Deep South) allows him to use archetypes of the classic thriller (the FBI, major newspapers, towns with secrets) that are familiar and universal.
*   **Emotional Darkness:** The environment often reflects the characters' internal state: rain, basements, dense forests, or empty rooms that emphasize loneliness.

### 3. Language and Stylistic Devices

His prose is direct, yet it is sprinkled with very powerful and visceral lyrical images.

#### A. Sensory and Abstract Metaphors

Castillo has a unique way of describing feelings. He avoids clichés and seeks physical images for pain or fear.

*   **Device:** Comparing an emotion to a sharp object or a destructive natural phenomenon.
*   **Example:** "Guilt was a hungry animal gnawing at my nerve endings every time I closed my eyes."

#### B. Diction and Recurring Vocabulary

He uses words that evoke fragility and mystery:

*   *Pieces, glass, broken, abyss, darkness, heartbeat, destiny, chance, pieces, truth, lie.*

#### C. The Introspective First Person

He often gives voice to the protagonist through a very intimate first person. This allows for:

*   **Unreliable narrator:** The reader only knows what the character remembers or chooses to tell.
*   **Emotional immersion:** Feeling the character's confusion and anxiety as your own.

### 4. Character Construction: "Broken People"

In Castillo's universe, no one is "fine." Everyone carries emotional baggage.

*   **Trauma as the Driving Force:** The central conflict always stems from an unhealed wound from the past.
*   **Professions of Truth:** His protagonists are often journalists (like Miren Triggs), writers, or investigators. People whose social function is to ask questions, which justifies the search for clues.
*   **Moral Duality:** He explores the boundary between good and evil. His "heroes" often commit morally questionable acts to achieve an end.

### 5. Central Themes

To write with Castillo's signature style, the plot must pivot on these axes:

*   **The Disappearance:** The void left by someone who vanishes without a trace.
*   **Destiny vs. Chance:** The idea that an insignificant decision can destroy an entire life years later.
*   **Family Secrets:** The family as a place of love, but also as the repository of the darkest lies.
*   **Identity:** People who discover they are not who they thought they were.

### Checklist for the "Castillo Style"

*   [ ] Have I started the chapter with Date and Location?
*   [ ] Have I ended the chapter with a shocking twist or revelation?
*   [ ] Are there at least two intertwining timelines?
*   [ ] Have I used a visceral metaphor to describe fear or sadness?
*   [ ] Is my protagonist a person "marked" by a past event?
*   [ ] Is the pace fast enough to prevent the reader from stopping?

# CHAPTER 3: The Improvised Morgue

**Aigüestortes, December 20, 2018**

The journey from the police station to the Primary Care Center was an exercise in silent restraint. The snow, which hours earlier had fallen with the delicacy of a warning, had transformed into solid curtains battering the patrol car's windshield. The wipers moaned rhythmically, struggling against the white accumulation, a desperate metronome marking the time slipping through their fingers.

Elena Vives watched the landscape blur on the other side of the glass. The valley closed in on itself, swallowing the pines and roads beneath a gullet of fog and ice. Beside her, Lucas Riera drove, his white knuckles clenched on the steering wheel. The police chief hadn't uttered a word in the ten-minute drive, but the cabin smelled of his fear; an acrid, metallic aroma, distinct from the stale tobacco ingrained in the upholstery. Every time he braked on a curve, his right leg trembled slightly, an involuntary spasm he tried to disguise by clenching his jaw. The change in atmospheric pressure must have been tormenting his old injury, though physical pain was probably the least of his burdens now that Isabel's body traveled in the forensic van behind them.

The vehicle stopped in front of the emergency entrance, a stone and slate structure that looked more like a beleaguered fortress than a place of healing.

"Arnald is waiting for us downstairs," Lucas said. His voice sounded sanded, rough from disuse and excessive emotion.

They descended to the basement via a service ramp, pushing the gurney covered by a black vinyl bag. The wheels creaked on the linoleum, a sharp sound that echoed off the bare concrete walls. This was no real morgue; Aigüestortes didn't have enough dead people to justify one. It was a refrigerated storage room, hastily set up, where boxes of medical supplies were stacked in the corners like mute spectators.

Doctor Arnald Soler waited in the center of the room, under the flickering light of two fluorescent tubes that bathed the room in a sickly, greenish hue. The doctor adjusted his latex gloves with dry, precise movements. Despite the ambient temperature, which hovered around five degrees Celsius, a thin layer of sweat beaded on his broad forehead.

"Lucas," the doctor greeted, ignoring Elena for a moment. His tone lacked the paternal warmth he usually dispensed. "I regret that we have to do this here. The conditions are... suboptimal."

"Do what you can, Arnald," the policeman replied, staying by the door, as if an invisible barrier prevented him from approaching the metal table.

Elena took a step forward. The air smelled of a disturbing mixture of subterranean dampness and that pungent mint-and-disinfectant aroma that seemed to emanate from Doctor Soler's very skin.

"We need to document every inch before the ambient temperature alters the tissues," she interjected, her voice devoid of emotional inflection. It was the profiler's voice, just another tool in the room. "The chain of custody begins and ends with what we see now."

Soler looked at her then. There was a resistance in his eyes, a defensive opacity.

"I know how to do my job, Miss Vives. I've signed more death certificates in this valley than you've read in your reports."

Without waiting for a reply, the doctor unzipped the bag. The sound, similar to the ripping of thick fabric, seemed to absorb all the oxygen from the basement.

Isabel appeared before them not as a corpse, but as a toppled statue. The freezing had halted decomposition, maintaining her features in a frightening suspension. Her skin had the color of blue-veined marble, and frost formed tiny crystals on her eyelashes, granting her a cruel, artificial beauty. She didn't look dead; she looked paused.

Elena felt a familiar pressure in her chest, the claw of emotional claustrophobia scratching from within. *Order*, she told herself, seeking the weight of her father's watch on her left wrist. *Find order in the chaos*.

She approached the table, invading the doctor's personal space. Lucas let out a choked sigh from the doorway, but didn't move.

"There are no evident livor mortis marks," Soler murmured, shining a flashlight over the girl's torso. "The cold stopped circulation before the blood could settle. Probable cause: severe hypothermia after an accidental fall."

"Too fast, Doctor," Elena corrected. Her green eyes scanned the body not as one looks at a person, but as one reads a topographical map. "Look at her hands."

Isabel's hands were crossed over her chest. Not in the defensive position of someone trying to protect themselves from a fall, nor cramped, seeking warmth. They were placed. Set there with intentionality.

Elena took out her digital camera and began to shoot. The flash exploded, bouncing off the cerulean skin, revealing details that the naked eye might miss.

"Let's remove her clothes. I need to see the skin," Elena ordered.

Soler hesitated for a second, his gloved hands hovering over the victim's synthetic coat.

"She's stiff as a board. We'll have to cut the fabric."

With trauma shears, the doctor began to cut through the layers of clothing. The sound of the fabric tearing was violent in the sepulchral silence. When Isabel's torso was exposed, a dense, leaden silence fell over the three of them.

There were no disordered bruises. No open fractures with splintered bone breaking through the dermis.

What there was, was a map.

Elena leaned in, holding her breath. On Isabel's abdomen, and climbing towards her ribs, there were lines. These were not scratches caused by rocks or branches in a desperate fall. They were incisions. Clean, surgical cuts, traced with a precision that chilled the blood more than the room's temperature.

"What is this?" Lucas asked, his voice broken from the gloom. He had approached without realizing it, drawn by the magnetic horror of the scene.

Elena ran a gloved finger close to one of the lines, without touching it.

"The edges are perfect," she whispered, feeling a knot of intellectual revulsion form in her stomach. "There's no vital reaction. No inflammation, no tissue retraction."

She looked at Soler. The doctor was pale, his eyes fixed on the marks with an indecipherable expression.

"Doctor, these incisions were made *post-mortem*," Elena affirmed, and the sentence hung in the stale air. "Someone opened her, or tried to, after her heart stopped beating. And then... closed her again with almost invisible intradermal sutures."

Soler shook his head, a spasmodic movement.

"Impossible. That... that could be the effect of ice expanding the skin, or friction with a sharp surface of the glacier. Nature can be capricious, Elena. You see intentions where there are only geological accidents."

"Nature doesn't use a scalpel, Arnald," she retorted, her tone hardening. She pointed to a Y-shaped incision over the sternum. "This is embalming technique. Or preservation."

"That's absurd!" the doctor exploded, stepping back as if the physical accusation of the cuts personally offended him. "Who would do such a thing in the middle of a storm, on top of a mountain? You're seeing ghosts, girl. You're projecting your big-city traumas onto our misfortune."

Lucas looked alternately at Elena and the body, lost in a labyrinth of pain and confusion.

"Elena..." he began to say, "Arnald has been taking care of us for thirty years. If he says the ice..."

"Ice preserves, Lucas. Ice tells the truth men want to hide," she interrupted him, turning to face the doctor. "These marks are art. Someone took the time to work on her while she was freezing. It wasn't a fall. It was a staging."

A subtle, almost imperceptible sound stopped the argument.

*Drip.*

*Plink.*

A drop of condensed water slid down Isabel's arm and fell onto the metal table. Then another. The heat generated by the living bodies and the precarious lighting was beginning to win the battle against the cold that preserved the evidence.

Isabel's skin, until now immaculate porcelain, began to shine with a thin film of moisture. Time, that relentless enemy Elena tried to control with her father's watch, had started again.

"She's defrosting," Elena said, feeling the urgency rise in her throat like bile. "If these incisions soften, we'll lose the geometry of the edges. We need molds. We need macroscopic photography. Now."

Soler crossed his arms, stepping between Elena and the instruments.

"I will not allow you to desecrate the body of a girl I watched grow up based on conspiracy theories. We'll wait for the investigating judge. We'll wait for the storm to pass."

"By the time the storm passes," Elena said, pointing to the tiny puddle beginning to form under the victim's elbow, "the evidence will have dissolved in dirty water. And the killer knows it."

Lucas looked at Isabel's body, the girl he perhaps loved, or perhaps protected, now becoming an enigma dissolving before his eyes. The water continued to fall, slow, inexorable, marking the rhythm of a countdown that no one knew how to stop.

## Chapter 4: Fronteras Cerradas

**C-28 Road, Access to Bohí Valley**
**December 20, 2018**
**5:45 PM**

The journey from the village to the mountain pass wasn't a trip; it was a battle against the whiteness. Lucas Riera felt the Jeep's tires chewing on the virgin snow, searching for traction on asphalt that had ceased to exist hours ago. The windshield wipers fought a losing battle, drawing frantic arcs that barely granted seconds of visibility before the storm blinded the glass once more.

His right knee throbbed with a rhythm of its own, a biological alarm more precise than any barometer. Atmospheric pressure plummeted, and with it, his ailing joint reminded him of his own fragility. Lucas gritted his teeth, clinging to the steering wheel with his large, calloused hands, forcing himself to ignore the throbbing pain climbing up his thigh. There was no time for weakness.

In the distance, amber strobe lights stained the fog a sickly orange. It was the only color in a world that had turned monochrome.

Lucas stopped the vehicle beside the Civil Guard patrol car blocking the way. The wind howled, a sharp lament that seeped even through the car's insulation. As he opened the door, the cold slapped him with the violence of a solid object. The icy air snaked into his lungs, burning on entry, with that pure, metallic taste of high altitudes.

Sergeant Miralles stood beside the snowplow, a yellow hulk of heavy machinery lying inert, twisted at an unnatural angle against the guardrail, like a prehistoric animal felled in the middle of the tundra.

Lucas limped forward, sinking his boots into twelve inches of powder snow. The gale tried to push him back, but his broad build served as an anchor.

“Chief!” Miralles shouted to be heard over the blizzard’s roar. His breath instantly crystallized in his beard. “This is goddamn madness!”

Lucas didn’t respond immediately. His dark eyes, accustomed to reading scenes of misfortune, scanned the surroundings. Visibility was no more than five meters. Beyond that, the road disappeared into a white abyss. The snowplow, his only hope for keeping the artery connecting Aigüestortes to the civilized world open, was dead.

Beside the driver’s cabin, a man in grease-stained reflective overalls gesticulated desperately. It was Pau, the municipal worker. His face was distorted by cold and fear.

“It stopped dead!” Pau bellowed, waving an unlit cigarette between his gloved fingers. “I swear the engine was perfect this morning! I did the check myself!”

Lucas approached the side of the machine. The smell of diesel and hydraulic fluid was pungent, an olfactory stain on the sterile purity of the mountain. He crouched down, ignoring his knee’s protest, and directed his flashlight beam into the mechanical entrails of the vehicle.

What he saw sent a colder void through his stomach than the outside temperature.

On the immaculate snow, beneath the chassis, a dark, viscous puddle spread. It looked like black blood gushing from an open wound. Lucas followed the fluid’s trail to its source: the main hydraulic system hoses.

They weren’t burst by pressure. There was no chaotic fraying indicative of wear-and-tear.

They were clean cuts. Precise. Surgical.

Lucas removed his right glove and ran his fingertips along the edge of one of the severed tubes. The rubber had been sliced with a sharp tool, an oblique cut designed to drain the system in minutes.

He straightened up slowly, feeling the weight of the police badge on his chest, a weight that suddenly felt useless.

“This wasn’t a breakdown, Pau,” Lucas said, his grave voice cutting through the icy air with an authority he didn’t feel inside.

Miralles approached, wide-eyed.
“What do you mean, Lucas?”

“They cut the brakes and the power steering. Someone got underneath with a knife or a box cutter.”

The silence that followed his words was heavier than the storm. The three men looked at each other, sharing a tacit and terrifying understanding. The machine hadn’t broken by chance. It had been murdered.

Lucas turned toward the road, south, toward where the valley exit should be. The snow was falling more heavily now, large, wet flakes piling up at dizzying speed, erasing any trace of asphalt, turning the mountain pass into an impassable wall.

“How long will it take to send another machine from Vielha?” Miralles asked, though his tone suggested he already knew the answer.

“With this storm…” Pau shook his head, looking at the leaden sky. “Nobody’s coming up today. Not tomorrow. We’re talking meters of accumulation in the next few hours. If we don’t clear this now, the access road will be blocked.”

“It already is,” Lucas stated.

The police chief walked to the edge of the precipice, where the guardrail barely peeked out from under the white blanket. He looked down into the darkness of the valley that stretched out at his feet. The village lights were mere dying fireflies in the distance, swallowed by the blizzard.

The feeling of claustrophobia closed in on him like a fist. It wasn’t just the geographical isolation. It was the certainty of intent. Someone had sabotaged the snowplow on purpose. Someone wanted no one to enter.

But, more importantly, someone wanted no one to leave.

He remembered Isabel’s body in the medical center’s basement, the perfect incisions, the ice preserving the horror. And now this. The puzzle pieces began to fit together with a sinister click. They weren’t dealing with an accident or an isolated crime of passion.

Lucas took out his radio, but only got static, a white crackle that mimicked the visual chaos surrounding them. The valley’s topography, combined with the electrical storm accompanying the snow, had erected a wall of silence.

“Sergeant,” Lucas ordered, putting away the radio and returning to his car. His limp was more pronounced now, but his determination had hardened his features. “Set up the concrete barriers. Block the entrance completely. Don’t let anyone come up here only to get trapped.”

“What about us?” Miralles asked, looking at the disappearing road.

Lucas got into the Jeep and closed the door, isolating himself again from the wind, but not from the cold that had settled into his bones. He looked in the rearview mirror, watching the snow begin to cover the yellow corpse of the snowplow, burying the evidence of the sabotage.

“We’re going back down,” Lucas said to himself, starting the engine. “To lock ourselves in with them.”

The trap was already laid. Aigüestortes Valley was no longer a tourist refuge; it was a cage of glass and ice, and the key had just been thrown into the abyss.

## Chapter 5: El Huésped Invisible

**Aigüestortes, Boí Valley**
**December 20, 2018**

The journey from Dr. Soler's clinic to the Sanatorio Hotel was no more than three hundred meters, but the storm had erased any notion of distance or geography. The "White Beast" wasn't just a simple snowfall; it was a solid wall, a living organism that pushed Elena Vives to the ground, trying to bury her before she could take another step.

Every inhalation was a punishment. The icy air entered her lungs like ground glass, burning her throat and freezing her eyelashes into heavy needles of ice. She shielded her face with her forearm, fighting against a wind that howled with the fury of a thousand laments. Her mountaineering boots, designed for extreme terrain, slipped on the layer of ice that was already beginning to form beneath the fresh snow.

When the hotel's silhouette emerged from the blackness, it looked more like a giant tombstone than a refuge. The building, a mass of stone and slate from the turn of the century, stood defiantly against the elements, its dark windows watching the valley like empty sockets.

Elena stumbled up the entrance steps, her numb hands fumbling for the brass doorknob. She pushed. The heavy oak door yielded, and she slipped inside, closing it behind her with a dull thud that abruptly severed the roar of the wind.

The silence that followed was absolute, almost liturgical.

She stood there for a moment, leaning against the wood, allowing her breathing to stabilize. The warmth of the lobby struck her not like a caress, but like a change in atmospheric pressure that made her ears ring. She took off her ski goggles; condensation blurred her vision for a second before dissipating.

The Sanatorio Hotel's lobby was a cavern of decadent luxury. High ceilings with plaster moldings depicting hunting scenes, Persian rugs worn by decades of footsteps, and an immense chandelier hanging like a sword of Damocles over the center of the room. No one was there. Only the ticking of a grandfather clock that echoed against the dark wood-paneled walls.

Elena moved forward. Her steps on the marble produced a damp, intrusive echo. She brought her hand to her left wrist and caressed the cold face of her father's watch, an automatic gesture, an anchor when the mental tide rose too high. Quarter past eight.

"Hello?" her voice came out hoarse, small in the immensity of the space.

Behind the mahogany counter, a figure straightened up. She hadn't seen him; he blended with the gloom in the background. He was a gaunt man, of indeterminate age, dressed in a suit that seemed to have been elegant thirty years ago. His skin had the tone of old paper.

"The kitchen is closed, madam," the man said without preamble. His tone was neutral, devoid of hospitality or rejection. He simply stated a fact.

"I'm not looking for food. I need a room."

The concierge—or manager, or the spirit guarding that mausoleum—tilted his head. His watery eyes scanned Elena's technical clothing, her soaked backpack, and the ice axe protruding from one side.

"We have ninety rooms. Eighty-nine are empty. You can choose the view you prefer, though tonight they all look out onto the same white hell."

"Any will do. I just want to get these off," she said, gesturing to her wet clothes.

The man slid a large registration book across the polished surface of the counter. He opened the pages with an exasperating slowness. The paper crinkled, dry and brittle.

"Name and ID, please. I am Mr. Baró."

Elena fumbled in her inner pocket with clumsy fingers until she found her wallet. While Baró transcribed her details in spiky, angular handwriting, her gaze wandered over the open page. Obsession, that old companion that had turned her into one of the best profilers and then into an emotional wreck, took over.

She looked for patterns. She looked for anomalies.

The page was desolate. December was the dead season, the limbo between autumn and the arrival of January's skiers. There was only one recent entry, dated the previous day.

*Room 302.*

The ink was black, fresh, contrasting with the faded blue of November's annotations. But it wasn't the room number that stopped Elena's heart for a beat, but the name.

*Mr. Pygmalion.*

Elena blinked. Read again. The letters were there, firm, arrogant.

"Do you have another guest?" she asked, trying to make her voice sound casual, though the knot in her stomach tightened.

Baró looked up from Elena's ID. He followed the direction of her finger.

"Ah. The gentleman in 302. A peculiar man."

"Peculiar?"

"He arrived yesterday, before the sky fell. Paid cash, a week in advance. Asked for absolute privacy." Baró shrugged, a mechanical movement of his thin bones. "He hasn't even come down to eat. I suppose he's looking for inspiration or a hiding place. In this valley, they're often the same thing."

*Pygmalion.* The mythical sculptor who fell in love with his own creation. A name no one uses in a hotel register unless they want to send a message, or are playing God.

Elena felt a pang at the base of her skull. The scar on her left hand itched, a phantom reminder. In the clinic's basement, Isabel's body presented precise, surgical incisions, as if someone had tried to remodel her. And now, less than a kilometer away, a guest was checking in under the name of a creator of living statues.

Coincidences don't exist. Only pieces we don't know how to fit together.

"Have you seen him today?" Elena insisted.

"No one has seen him. Room service leaves the tray at the door and picks it up untouched. Perhaps he sleeps. Perhaps he writes. It's not my business as long as he doesn't burn the curtains."

Baró turned the book towards her and offered her a heavy pen. Elena signed. Her own handwriting seemed shaky next to the invisible guest's signature.

"I'll give you 204," the manager said, unhooking a heavy key from a wooden board full of empty hooks. "Second floor. Right below him, if that concerns you. The ceilings are high, you won't hear a thing."

Elena took the key. The metal was icy cold.

"Thank you."

She headed towards the grand central staircase. The elevator, a wrought-iron cage, seemed out of order or simply too eerie to try. As she ascended, the sound of her boots on the varnished wood echoed in the lobby's dome.

One. Two. Three steps.

The hotel creaked. The wood contracted from the temperature change, the pipes sang old songs in the walls. These were the normal sounds of an old building settling for the night.

But then, something broke the usual symphony.

She stopped on the first landing, clutching the banister.

Upstairs. On the third floor.

It wasn't a creak. It was a drag. Slow, deliberate. Something heavy being moved across a rough surface. _Ssshhhk. Ssshhhk._

Elena looked up, into the darkness of the upper floor's railing. The lobby light didn't reach there; shadows gathered like black water.

"Mr. Baró?" she called, leaning over the handrail to look down.

The manager was no longer behind the counter. The lobby was empty.

The sound repeated. _Ssshhhk._ Right above her head. A piece of furniture being shifted, or perhaps something inert being dragged towards the edge.

Her breathing quickened. The sense of security promised by the hotel's thick walls evaporated. That place wasn't a refuge; it was a sounding board. And she had just locked herself inside with something that didn't want to be seen, but was definitely awake.

She clutched the key in her fist until the edges dug into her flesh, using the pain to focus her mind. She climbed the next step. She had to reach her room, lock the bolt, and wait for dawn. Or for Lucas to arrive.

But Lucas was outside, in the storm, and inside, in the gloom of the third floor, "Mr. Pygmalion" had just taken a step.

## Chapter 6: Cicatrices en la Memoria

**Hotel Sanatorio, Aigüestortes**
**December 21, 2018**

Dawn didn't arrive as a promise of light, but as a slight variation in the grayscale that choked the valley. Elena Vives opened her eyes, though technically she had never fully closed them. The vigil had been a demanding companion, sitting at the foot of the bed in room 204, watching the sway of the curtains stirred by invisible drafts.

She sat up. The sheets, damp with a cold sweat that contradicted the glacial temperature of the room, clung to her skin. She looked at her left wrist. Her father's watch read six twelve. The second hand advanced with that mechanical indifference she so envied; time felt no fear, it simply passed.

She picked up the digital camera from the nightstand. Her numb fingers clumsily sought the buttons until the small LCD screen illuminated the gloom with a bluish glow.

There it was. The image she had captured before the storm swallowed everything.

It wasn't just a corpse. Elena zoomed in on the photo until the pixels turned into abstract blocks of cyan and white. The victim's posture showed no struggle, nor that rictus of agony that contorts muscles when death arrives violently. The girl seemed to be sleeping within the block of ice, suspended in an eternal parenthesis.

“There’s no chaos,” she whispered, and her own voice sounded strange, hoarse from disuse during the night.

This wasn't a crime of passion. Anger is messy; it leaves stains, breakages, entropic chaos. This was architecture. It was design. Someone had taken the trouble to compose the scene with the precision of a museum conservator.

Elena set her feet on the floor. The wood creaked, a dry groan that resonated in her temples. She needed to understand the setting to comprehend the work. Hotel Sanatorio wasn't a mere building; its walls, covered in peeling wallpaper like dead skin, breathed a history the present tried to ignore.

She dressed quickly, layering wool and technical fabric, and stepped out into the hallway.

The silence on the second floor was dense, almost liquid. She walked towards the staircase, avoiding the central planks she knew would betray her position. Below, the lobby lay in gloom, with the furniture covered by sheets that looked like crouching ghosts awaiting their turn. But her destination wasn't the exit, blocked by tons of snow, but the east wing, where the previous day she had glimpsed a double-leaf door with frosted glass.

*Library*. Or what remained of it.

She pushed the door open. The hinges protested with a sharp screech that raised the hairs on the back of her neck. The scent hit her first: a mix of decaying cellulose, old leather, and that sickly sweet, stale aroma time acquires when stagnant in enclosed spaces.

The room was a mausoleum of forgotten knowledge. Dark oak shelves rose to the ceiling, filled with volumes no one had consulted in decades. The outdoor light, filtered by the storm, barely entered as a dirty haze, insufficient for reading. Elena took a small flashlight from her pocket and traced a beam of light over the spines.

*Treatises on anatomy. Natural philosophy. Climate records.*

Her hands moved with the urgency of someone seeking air underwater. She wasn't looking for fiction. She was looking for logic. If the killer, that supposed 'Pygmalion' from the registry book, was using this place, there had to be a reason. Territorial predators don't choose their lairs randomly; they seek ecosystems that favor their nature.

She passed by the accounting section. Invoices from 1980, electricity bills... too recent. She kept going further back. A cardboard box, damp at the base, contained bundles of documents tied with twine.

1965. 1958.

Elena set the flashlight on a reading table and untied the knot of one of the oldest bundles. Dust rose in a microscopic cloud, making her cough into the sleeve of her sweater. They were medical journals. Logbooks of the doctors who managed the place when the 'Sanatorium' lived up to its name, treating tuberculosis and respiratory ailments of the Catalan bourgeoisie.

She opened a black-covered notebook, its corners eaten away by dampness. The handwriting was sharp, strict, penned with a fountain pen that tolerated no smudges.

*January 14, 1952. Outside temperature: -15ºC.*

Elena turned the pages, her green eyes scanning for keywords, filtering out the administrative chaff: *supplies, morphine, bandages...*

She stopped. Her index finger, marked by the thin crescent-shaped scar, rested on a paragraph that seemed to vibrate with a dark energy.

*“Subject 04. Controlled induction of hypothermia shows promising results in slowing tissue deterioration. Cold should not be seen as an enemy, but as natural formaldehyde. If we stop the flow, we stop time.”*

Her heart gave a painful lurch, beating against her ribs like a trapped bird. She continued reading. These weren't notes on how to cure illness. They were observations on preservation. On how to maintain life's beauty right at the threshold of extinction.

*“The art of rudimentary cryogenics requires patience. The crystallization of water in cells is the artist's failure. The goal is vitrification. A state of perfect suspension.”*

Elena recoiled from the book as if the letters burned. Her breathing quickened, fogging the air in front of her mouth. She looked around, and the library's shadows seemed to lengthen, taking on grotesque forms.

This wasn't new. The crime of the frozen young woman wasn't a macabre innovation by a modern psychopath. It was a citation. A homage.

The hotel had housed an experimental program in the 1950s. A project obsessed not with curing death, but with perfecting the corpse.

“You’re replicating the method,” she whispered to the empty room, feeling the puzzle pieces click into place with a metallic sound in her mind.

The killer didn't just know the hotel. He had studied its archives. Perhaps he saw himself as the heir to that perverse science, the gifted student who had finally achieved what those doctors only dreamed of: eternity through ice.

A dull thud, coming from the floor above, broke her concentration. It wasn't the wind. It was the unmistakable sound of a heavy object being dragged across the wooden floor. Directly above her head.

Elena abruptly switched off the flashlight, plunging herself into darkness, with the absolute certainty that history was about to repeat itself. And she was at the center of the page.

## Chapter 7: Sangre en la Nieve

**Aigüestortes, perimeter of Sant Maurici Lake**
**December 22, 2018, 08:15 AM**

The mountain held no secrets; it simply buried them under layers of white silence.

Lucas Riera limped forward, though he tried to hide it by digging his left heel harder into the crusty snow. His right knee, that old weather station made of cartilage and screws, throbbed with a dull rhythm, announcing what the leaden gray sky was already shouting: the storm was close. The "White Beast" was not a metaphor for the locals; it was a sentence.

Ahead of him, the leather leash tightened like a violin string about to snap. Roco, a German Shepherd with dark fur and a grizzled muzzle, pulled with a determination that bordered on madness. The animal wasn't sniffing the ground; he was drinking the air, capturing invisible molecules that the icy breeze dragged down from the high altitudes.

"Easy, boy," Lucas murmured, his breath crystallizing into an ephemeral cloud in front of his face.

Elena Vives walked two paces behind. The crunch of her technical boots on the ice broke the stillness of the black pine forest. Her hands were stuffed into the pockets of her parka, but Lucas knew that inside, her fingers would be caressing the cold face of her father's watch. A nervous tic. An anchor.

"The tracks disappear here," she said. Her voice sounded small, absorbed by the immensity of the trees.

Lucas stopped and observed the ground. She was right. The wind had begun to sweep the surface, erasing the recent history of the forest. What yesterday were deep boot marks, today were vague depressions, shadows in the snow that could be footsteps or mere whims of the melt.

"The night wind," the officer conceded, adjusting his jacket collar. "But Roco doesn't follow visual tracks. He follows the scent of fear. Or something worse."

The dog let out a low, guttural whimper. It wasn't the usual warning bark, but a wet, primitive sound. He stopped dead in his tracks in front of a rocky outcrop, a vertical granite wall where pine roots twisted like exposed veins seeking the earth.

Elena approached, her green eyes scanning the surroundings with that clinical precision that both fascinated and terrified Lucas. She didn't look at the landscape; she dissected it.

"There," Elena pointed.

A narrow crack, barely a scar on the rock, made its way between two lichen-covered, frost-dusted blocks of stone. It was a natural, shallow cave, but enough to conceal a crouching man. Or to hide his sins.

Roco refused to move forward. The animal sat back on his haunches, the hair on his back bristling, and bared his teeth toward the darkness of the fissure.

Lucas released the safety of his service weapon; the metallic click sounded obscenely loud in the morning stillness.

"Stay behind," he ordered, though he knew she wouldn't.

The officer advanced, switching on his tactical flashlight. The beam of light cut through the gloom of the cave, revealing a space no bigger than a pantry. The air inside was stagnant, protected from the blizzard, and carried an aroma that made Lucas's stomach violently clench.

It didn't smell of dead animal, nor of decaying vegetation.

It smelled of cleanliness.

It was a chemical, pungent stench, a mix of isopropyl alcohol and something sweetish, mentholated, that didn't belong in the wild. It was the smell of hospital corridors at three in the morning.

"My God," Elena whispered behind him.

The flashlight beam illuminated a flat stone surface, a natural slab that had been meticulously cleaned of dust and debris. On it, arranged with a sickly symmetry, several objects rested.

They weren't trash. They were tools.

A scalpel with a stainless steel handle gleamed with a bluish sheen under the beam of light. Beside it, hemostatic forceps and an open roll of gauze, immaculate. And a small, uncapped amber glass vial, from which that synthetic mint vapor emanated.

Elena stepped forward, ignoring protocol, drawn to the scene like a moth to a flame.

"It's not a hiding place," she said, her voice trembling but firm, analyzing the data as her mind processed the horror. "It's a workstation. A field workshop."

Lucas felt bile rise in his throat. The idea that someone had been there, in the middle of nowhere, preparing surgical instruments with the patience of a craftsman, was more terrifying than any corpse. It implied planning. It implied that the pain inflicted was not a means, but an end.

"This is recent," Lucas noted, drawing his hand near without touching anything. "The steel had no frost. Someone was here this morning. Perhaps an hour ago."

The dog, who had remained at the entrance growling toward the darkness of the forest, suddenly changed his demeanor.

His ears perked up, swiveling like satellite dishes to the east, towards the denser thicket where the trees closed in, forming a black wall.

"Roco, stay!" Lucas warned, feeling the tension in the leash slacken an instant before the tug.

The animal barked, a sonic burst that echoed off the stone walls, and then, something broke. Not the leash, but the discipline. An instinct older than police training took control. The dog detected something humans couldn't see or hear.

With a sudden lunge, Roco thrashed; the choke collar dug into his neck, but he didn't care. The wet leather slipped from Lucas's gloved hand, numbed by the cold.

"Roco, no! STOP!" Lucas yelled.

The German Shepherd shot off like a black arrow across the white snow, plunging into the forest, chasing a shadow, a scent, a ghost.

"Lucas!" Elena cried out, watching the officer try to run after him, but his right leg gave out, causing him to stumble over a hidden root.

Lucas fell to his knees, letting out a grunt of pain and frustration, pounding the snow with his fist.

Roco's barks rapidly faded into the distance, mixing with the whistling wind that was beginning to pick up in the treetops. And then, as suddenly as they had begun, they ceased.

An absolute silence, heavy as a marble slab, fell over the forest.

Lucas rose with difficulty, his face pale, his gaze fixed in the direction where his partner had disappeared. The loneliness, suddenly, became physical, tangible. They were no longer the hunters.

In that clearing, surrounded by surgical tools and virgin snow, they had just become the prey.

## Chapter 8: La Lista de Pacientes

**Aigüestortes**
**December 21, 2018**

The descent from the cave was not a retreat, but a slow fall into hell.

The Jeep Wrangler devoured the curves of the forest road with a mechanical violence that made the axles groan, but Lucas Riera barely registered the vehicle's jolts. His world had shrunk to two points of unbearable pain: the agonizing throb in his right knee, which burned as if someone had driven a red-hot nail beneath his kneecap, and the emptiness in the passenger seat.

Roco's absence weighed more heavily than gravity.

Every time he glanced in the rearview mirror, hoping to see his German Shepherd's wet snout or hear that rhythmic panting that had been the soundtrack of his life for the past five years, he only found the empty, mud-stained upholstery. Guilt was an acid eating away at his stomach. He had left him behind. He had prioritized Elena's safety, logic, protocol, and in return, the mountain had swallowed his only family.

The wipers struggled against a mixture of snow and hail that was beginning to congeal on the windshield, a white curtain threatening to bury the entire valley. The White Beast was no longer just a weather warning; it was scratching at the village gates.

Lucas braked abruptly in front of the Town Hall, ignoring the restricted parking area. He got out of the car without closing the door. His right boot hit the icy asphalt and his leg gave way momentarily, forcing him to lean on the warm hood to keep from hitting the ground. He growled, an animal sound lost in the howling wind, and forced his body upright. Limping, dragging a trail of dirty water and dead leaves, he climbed the stone steps two at a time, propelled by a fury that blurred his peripheral vision.

He ignored the receptionist's greeting. He ignored the Christmas carols playing over the hallway speakers. He burst into the mayor's office without knocking, throwing open the double doors with such force that the wood slammed against the wall stop, creating a deafening crash that shook the portraits of former councillors.

Mayor Marta Vallés looked up from her papers. She sat behind her immaculate mahogany desk, dressed in a pearl-grey wool suit that was utterly uncreased. The room smelled of freshly brewed coffee and furniture polish, an obscene contrast to the scent of damp, dried blood, and fear that clung to Lucas's skin.

"Chief Riera," she said, with that rehearsed calm she used in municipal council meetings when the opposition grew difficult. "You look dreadful. Didn't anyone teach you to knock?"

Lucas advanced to the desk, leaving muddy footprints on the Persian rug. He leaned with both hands on the wooden surface, invading the woman's personal space.

"Enough with the formalities, Marta." His voice was hoarse, as if he had gravel in his throat. "I need full access to the Sanatorio's historical archives. Right now."

The Mayor took off her reading glasses and delicately placed them on a budget report. Her dark, calculating eyes swept over the officer's figure, pausing on the tremor in his hands and the waxy pallor of his face.

"The Sanatorio archives are sealed by data protection and heritage laws, Lucas. You know that better than I do. You can't just barge in there like a bull in a china shop because you have a hunch."

"It's not a hunch," he spat. He leaned in closer, lowering his voice to a dangerous whisper. "We found something up there. In the perimeter forest. There's a cave, Marta. A workshop. Someone's been operating there."

Marta didn't bat an eyelid, but Lucas, who had spent half his life reading gestures during interrogations, saw the instant tension at the corners of her lips. A micro-expression of recognition, not surprise.

"Operating?" she repeated, buying time. "You're delirious. The storm is getting to you, or perhaps it's that leg you refuse to treat. You should see a doctor."

"I found an amputated hand, frozen in a block of ice," Lucas blurted out, throwing the words like stones. "And surgical tools. And I know it's related to the renovations made to the north wing five years ago."

The Mayor stood up, smoothing her jacket. She walked towards the large window overlooking the square, turning her back to Lucas.

"Those renovations were necessary for the structure. The building was falling apart."

"Don't lie to me." Lucas slammed his fist on the table. "I checked the public records before I came up. The construction company was a front. And the funding... the funding didn't come from the Provincial Council, Marta. It came from the Town Hall's discretionary fund. Your signature is on the authorization."

Marta turned slowly. The mask of the amiable politician had vanished. Now there was steel in her gaze.

"It was an investment, Lucas. Wellness tourism. A high-level recovery center. The town is dying, we need income. If to secure private capital I had to look the other way concerning certain... antecedents of the building, then I did."

"Look the other way?" Lucas felt bile rise in his throat. "You funded the reconstruction of a slaughterhouse knowing what happened there in the seventies. You knew about the cryogenics experiments. You knew about the disappearances of the 'patients.' And now, someone is using those facilities, or what's left of them, to continue the work."

"Enough!" Marta's shout echoed in the office, sharp as a whip. "You're talking about absurd conspiracies. You're agitated, dirty, and frankly, you seem unhinged. I've been told you lost your dog. It's a shame, but grief doesn't give you the right to accuse me of criminal complicity."

The mention of Roco was a low blow that almost made him lose control. Lucas clenched his jaw until his teeth ached, fighting the urge to grab her by the lapels.

"Give me the archive key," he said, with a coldness that even startled himself. "Or I'll go to the press and tell them what happened to the nursery school money."

Marta sat back down, regaining control of the situation with a glacial smile. She opened a side drawer and pulled out a folder.

"You're not going anywhere, Riera. And you're not getting that key. In fact, if you don't leave my office in ten seconds and go home to sleep it off, I'll consider this gross insubordination. I've had your dismissal letter drafted since you started limping six months ago. All it needs is the date."

The threat hung in the air, tangible and poisonous. Lucas knew it wasn't a bluff. Marta had the power to take away his badge, his weapon, and the only thing that gave meaning to his empty days.

"Are you threatening my career while there's a psychopath loose on the mountain?" he asked, incredulous.

"I'm giving you a direct order. Go home. Wash up. And pray that when the storm passes, I'm in a good mood."

Lucas stared at her for a long second. He saw the arrogance in her eyes, the absolute certainty that she held all the cards. She believed she had won.

"Alright," he said, relaxing his shoulders in a gesture of apparent defeat. He took a step back, pretending his leg gave out again, and leaned heavily on the edge of the desk, near the inbox. "You win, Mayor. I'm leaving."

As she lowered her gaze to her documents, satisfied with his submission, Lucas's left hand moved with the swiftness of a pickpocket. His fingers closed around the brass keyring resting beside the paperweight, partially hidden beneath an open envelope. He recognized the worn label: *Basement / Archives*.

He slid the cold metal into his jacket sleeve in one fluid motion, pushing off the desk as he did so.

"But be clear about one thing, Marta," Lucas said from the doorway, his hand already on the knob. "If one more body turns up, their blood won't stain my boots. It'll stain your immaculate rug."

He stepped out into the hallway before she could respond.

The sound of the door closing was definitive. Lucas walked down the corridor, feeling the weight of the stolen key pressing against his wrist. The pain in his knee was still there, sharp and constant, and the image of Roco lost in the snow still tormented him, but now, mingled with the anguish, a new fuel burned in his chest.

He was no longer the Chief of Police following orders. Now he was a man with nothing to lose, and he had just declared war.

## Chapter 9: Anatomía de una Obsesión

CAPÍTULO: 9 - Anatomy of an Obsession

Hostal del Valle. Room 204.
December 21, 2018.

The return journey from the forest had been a blur of grey pines and thick silence, interrupted only by the groan of Lucas's Jeep engine battling the mud. He had dropped me off at the hostel entrance with a silent promise in his eyes and a strict order to lock myself in until he returned from the Town Hall. Now, alone within four floral-wallpapered walls, the building's security felt fragile, an eggshell beneath the boot of a storm that was beginning to howl beyond the windowpane.

I transformed the cheap wooden desk into a dissecting table. There were no corpses, only images captured with my digital camera and fragments of memory that burned hotter than dry ice. The photographs of the “workshop” in the cave unfolded across the varnished surface, forming a mosaic of madness.

My fingers, still numb from the residual cold of the cavern, traced the outline of the surgical instruments portrayed. Scalpels aligned with a precision that offended the natural chaos of the world. Unlabeled jars. And that tank.

“Order,” I whispered, and my own voice sounded alien in the empty room.

It wasn't a wild animal's lair. It was a temple.

I brought the nightstand lamp closer, forcing the tungsten bulb to reveal the secrets of the textures. The camera screen showed a close-up of the residue found on the cave's workbench. A viscous, translucent substance that didn't behave like water when freezing.

As a glaciologist, I understood the structure of cold. Water, upon solidifying, is brutal; its crystals are microscopic daggers that break cell membranes, tearing flesh from within. That's why bodies frozen in the mountains turn black, brittle. But what I had seen in the forest, and what I intuited about previous victims, was different. It was an immaculate preservation.

Vitrification.

The crescent-shaped scar on my left palm throbbed, a phantom reminder of old wounds. I rubbed my wrist, feeling the weight of my father's watch, its hands advancing oblivious to the horror I was trying to decode.

Someone didn't want to kill. Someone wanted to stop time.

Dry knocks on the door shattered my concentration. Three rhythmic, precise taps.

My hand flew instinctively to my jacket pocket, searching for a weapon I didn't have, before remembering where I was. I forced myself to breathe, filling my lungs with air that smelled of dust and furniture wax.

“Elena?” The voice on the other side was deep, familiar, laden with a paternal concern that, at another time, would have comforted me.

Dr. Arnald Soler.

I hastily covered the photographs with an unfolded tourist map and went to open the door.

Soler was in the hallway, his impeccable grey wool coat defying the wind lashing Aigüestortes. He held a leather medical bag in one hand and a brown paper bag in the other. His face, framed by that carefully trimmed grey beard, showed a practiced weariness.

“Lucas called me,” he said, stepping in almost before I moved aside. “He said he found you wandering near the perimeter, that you were agitated.”

Lucas’s lie to protect me. Clever.

“I just needed some air,” I replied, closing the door. The slide of the bolt was definitive. “The hotel suffocates me.”

Soler set his things on the bed. The room seemed to shrink with his presence. From the bag emanated the aroma of fresh coffee and croissants, a scent of normalcy that felt obscene given the circumstances.

“You look unwell, my dear.” He removed his leather gloves with slow, almost hypnotic movements. “Dilated pupils, paleness... Post-traumatic stress is a patient beast, Elena. It waits for you to drop your guard.”

“I’m fine, Arnald.” I crossed my arms, creating a physical barrier. “What are you really doing here?”

“Bringing you breakfast and making sure you don’t fall apart.” He opened his briefcase. The click of the metal clasps echoed like the cocking of a weapon. “And perhaps something for your nerves. A mild sedative. You need to sleep before the storm traps us all in.”

He approached the desk. My heart pounded against my ribs. The map covered the worst, but the edges of some photos peeked out.

“I don’t need to sleep. I need to understand.”

Soler paused, his blue gaze sweeping over the disarray of my improvised workstation. There was no curiosity in his eyes, but a clinical assessment.

“Understand what?” he asked, in a soft tone, the same one he used when I was a brilliant but volatile student.

“The physics of this.” I moved closer to the table and deliberately removed the map. I wanted to see his reaction. “Lucas and I found more than just trees in the forest.”

Soler didn’t flinch. He leaned over the images of the surgical instruments. His expression didn’t change, not a muscle tensed, which, paradoxically, was the most alarming reaction of all. A normal person would have asked what they were. An innocent doctor would have been surprised. He simply observed.

“It looks... rudimentary,” he commented, pointing at the photo of the jars.

“That’s what I thought at first.” I leaned against the window frame, letting the storm’s grey light bathe my profile. “But look at the residue on the table. It’s not normal ice.”

“It’s a cold place, Elena. Things freeze.”

“Not like this.” I turned to face him fully. “Water expands when it freezes. It breaks down tissues. This... this is different. It’s as if the water has been substituted.”

Soler straightened up, smoothing a non-existent wrinkle on his coat.

“Substituted? You’re talking about advanced cryobiology. That requires laboratories costing millions of euros, not a cave in the Pyrenees. Your imagination is looking for patterns where there’s only coincidence.”

“What if it’s not money that’s needed, but knowledge?” I threw the question like a hook. “A homemade compound. A mixture of glycerol and... what else? Dimethyl sulfoxide?”

Arnald let out a short, dry laugh, devoid of humor.

“Dimethyl sulfoxide is toxic at the concentrations needed to prevent total crystallization without industrial equipment. The subject would die before freezing, and the tissue would degrade due to chemical toxicity. You’d be left with an amorphous paste, not a statue.”

The answer flowed from him automatically, like a professor correcting a student.

“Then how would you explain that the samples I saw had no surface frost?” I insisted, taking a step toward him. “The skin was smooth. Perfect. Like porcelain.”

For the first time, Dr. Soler hesitated. It was a blink, a fraction of a second where his benevolent mentor mask cracked. His fingers tapped on the leather of his briefcase.

“Perhaps...” he began, choosing his words with surgical care, “perhaps if a modified ethylene glycol solution were used, with a stabilizing agent. Something that would rapidly increase viscosity to prevent ice nucleation.”

“Ethylene glycol. Antifreeze.”

“Refined,” he quickly corrected. “But that would generate a characteristic color. A bluish tint in the extremities.”

My mind clicked. The sound was deafening in my head.

I hadn’t told him anything about the color of the samples. The photos on the table were black and white prints I’d taken from the reception printer before coming up, or simply visualizations on the small camera screen which he hadn’t examined closely. And yet, he was visualizing the clinical result.

“Nobody mentioned bluish tints, Arnald.”

The silence that followed was dense, heavy as a lead blanket. The wind lashed the window, making the glass rattle in its frame.

Soler looked at me. There was no paternalism in his eyes anymore. There was a cold, calculating intelligence, the look of a chess player who realizes they’ve moved a pawn too early.

“It’s a medical hypothesis, Elena.” His voice dropped an octave, becoming dangerously soft. “I deduce based on physiology. If you inject that, cyanosis is inevitable. It’s textbook.”

“It’s not in the textbooks I studied. And I’ve read your complete bibliography.”

He smiled, but the smile didn’t reach his eyes.

“Medicine is a vast art. There are always dark corners not taught in universities, so as not to give ideas to... impressionable minds.”

He closed his briefcase with a dry snap.

“You should eat something. Sugar will help you think clearly. You’re seeing ghosts, Elena. And ghosts, when given too much attention, tend to become dangerous.”

“Is that a clinical or a personal threat?”

“It’s medical advice.” He walked to the door with a firm step. “The storm is going to get worse. Don’t go out. And stop playing detective with things that are beyond your comprehension. Nature has its own methods of preservation; it doesn’t need human help.”

He opened the door and the hallway air rushed in, bringing with it the distant echo of thunder.

“By the way,” he said, stopping in the doorway without turning, “that mixture you’re talking about... the proprietary one. If it existed, it would smell of bitter almonds and mint to mask the solvent. If you ever smell that, run.”

The door closed behind him.

I stood motionless, feeling the cold of the room seep into my bones. Almonds and mint.

I approached the table and picked up the camera. I zoomed in on one of the workshop photos, on a dark corner I had overlooked. There, barely visible behind a jar, was a box of industrial mint lozenges and, beside it, a dark glass container with a hand-engraved chemical symbol.

Soler hadn’t speculated. He had described the recipe.

I brought my hand to my mouth, feeling bile rise in my throat. He knew exactly what mixture was being used because it wasn’t a standard forensic technique. It was an author’s signature.

The “workshop” wasn’t just a place of butchery. It was a test lab for a thesis Arnald Soler had been writing in his head for years, or perhaps, executing with his own hands.

I looked at my father’s watch. The hands pointed to a quarter past one. Lucas was at the Town Hall, walking into the lion’s den with the Mayor, and I had just invited the wolf into my room.

I went to the door and bolted it, then dragged a chair and wedged it under the knob. A futile gesture, I knew. If Soler wanted in, he’d get in. If he was the Sculptor, or his mentor, no rotting wooden door would stop him.

My gaze returned to the tourist map on the table. Aigüestortes wasn’t a refuge; it was a giant Petri dish, and we were the cultures waiting to be frozen.

I had to warn Lucas. But when I took out my phone, the screen showed what I feared most: “No Service.”

The White Beast had arrived, and with it, total isolation. I was alone with the truth, and the truth had a metallic, poisonous taste.

## Chapter 10: La Jaula de Hielo

**Aigüestortes, December 21, 2018**
**8:00 PM**

The storm had ceased to be a mere meteorological phenomenon and had transformed into an entity with a will of its own. Outside, the snow wasn't falling; it was attacking. It hammered against the windows of the Hostal del Valle with the furious cadence of a thousand tiny fists demanding entry, burying the world under a white shroud that erased roads, paths, and any trace of civilization.

In room 204, Elena Vives felt the air thicken. It wasn't just the lack of ventilation, but the plummeting atmospheric pressure, an invisible weight pressing down on her chest and making the scar on her left palm throb with a dull rhythm.

She adjusted the digital camera's focus on the tissue sample. Through the macro lens, the vitrified flesh of the cave cadaver looked like an alien landscape, a geography of perfect crystals that defied biology. There was no cellular breakdown. That was the artist's signature: absolute preservation.

“It’s not natural ice,” she murmured to herself. Her voice sounded strange, absorbed by the wood-paneled walls.

She put the scalpel back into the forensic kit with a mechanical movement. Her fingers were stiff, and not just from the dropping temperature in the room. Doctor Soler’s lie about the chemical supplies floated in her mind like an oil slick on water. He had access. He knew how to stop biological time.

She brought her hand to her wrist and caressed the cold face of her father’s watch. The second hand lurched forward, the only rhythmic sound in that static chaos. Tick. Tock. Tick. She needed to leave that room, but the hallway felt as menacing as the blizzard outside.

***

Two kilometers away, at the local police station, Lucas Riera waged a losing battle against the static.

“Central, this is Aigüestortes. Do you read me? Over.”

The only response was an agonizing screech, a mixture of white noise and distortion that pierced his ear. He dropped the mic in frustration, letting it fall onto the desk covered with topographic maps.

His right leg was a block of pain. The drop in pressure announced disaster in his joints with more precision than any barometer. He massaged his thigh, feeling the tension of the muscles beneath the uniform fabric.

“Chief,” the young officer, Marcos, said, his voice trembling from the doorway. “The emergency generator for the antenna is coughing black smoke. The wind has bent one of the supports.”

Lucas stood up, ignoring the pang in his knee. He walked toward the armored window at the entrance. What he saw outside chilled his blood more than the mountain air.

The trees bent at impossible angles, like reeds before an invisible scythe.

“If we lose the antenna, we lose our eyes and our voice,” Lucas said, more to himself than to his subordinate. “We’re alone, Marcos.”

The young man nodded, pale. The radio emitted one last crack, like a bone snapping, and then fell silent forever.

***

Back at the Hostal, Doctor Arnald Soler crossed the deserted lobby. His footsteps were muffled by the Persian rugs, but the echo of his breathing was deafening to him. He wore his wool coat buttoned up to his neck, an insufficient armor against the cold seeping through the cracks of the old windows.

He stopped in front of the empty reception desk. The wood groaned under the assault of the wind. Arnald looked up the staircase leading to the second floor, where Elena Vives played detective with fragments of death. He knew she suspected. He had seen it in her green eyes, that analytical gaze that stripped intentions bare.

He plunged his hand into his pocket and squeezed the crumpled empty paper bag in his fist. He had to make a decision. The valley was closing in, transforming into a tomb of ice, and the secrets he had kept for decades threatened to surface with the thaw.

But there would be no thaw. Not soon.

***

The sound came first.

It wasn't thunder, but a metallic, sharp, and terrible ripping sound that echoed throughout the valley and overcame the wind's howl. It was the lament of steel yielding to nature.

On the northern slope, the telecommunications tower, the only umbilical cord connecting Aigüestortes to the twenty-first century, succumbed. The base bolts shot off like rifle bullets. The thirty-meter structure swayed once, twice, and then collapsed in slow motion, dragging the main power lines with it in a shower of blue sparks that illuminated the night for an instant, a photographic flash of the catastrophe.

In room 204, Elena’s bedside lamp flickered.

The light wavered, struggling to stay alive. Then, with an electric hum that sounded like a farewell, the bulb went out.

The laptop died.
The hum of the heating ceased.
The mechanical silence was instantaneous and absolute.

Elena stood motionless in the darkness. Her pupils dilated, desperately searching for a visual reference, but the world had shrunk to dense shadows. She rose from her chair, knocking over the forensic kit in her haste. The clatter of metal instruments hitting the floor was an explosion in the stillness.

She groped in the darkness until she found the window.

Outside, the village of Aigüestortes had ceased to exist. The streetlights on the main road, the lights of the houses on the hillside, the neon sign of the pharmacy... everything had been swallowed. There was no moon, no stars; only the grayish mass of the storm and the abyssal darkness that devoured everything.

Lucas, from the police station, watched as the blackness advanced through the valley like a tide of ink, swallowing building after building until it reached them. The emergency light on the ceiling flickered and, with a dry snap, the filament burned out.

“Shit,” Lucas whispered in the gloom.

They were blind. Deaf. Mute.

The “White Beast” had closed the cage.

Elena pressed her forehead against the icy windowpane of her room. Her breath fogged the glass, creating a barrier of mist that she had to wipe away with the cuff of her sleeve. She needed to see something, anything that would confirm she wasn't floating in a void.

And then, she saw it.

There, at the edge of the forest, where the black pines stood like sentinels of a forbidden kingdom.

A light.

It wasn't a streetlight, or a car. It was a fixed point of light, white, surgical. It shone with an unnatural intensity amidst the undergrowth, about three hundred meters from the hotel. It didn't flicker. It was there, static, defying the total darkness that had consumed the rest of the valley.

Elena felt her stomach clench into a fist. A chill that had nothing to do with the temperature ran down her neck, making the hairs on her arms stand on end. That light was not a distress signal.

It was an invitation.

Someone was out there, in the middle of the storm, with their own power source, watching the hotel. Watching her.

The light remained on for ten eternal seconds. Then, with the same abruptness with which the blackout had arrived, it extinguished, leaving a residual image on Elena’s retina and the absolute certainty that the hunt had begun.

## Chapter 11: El Visitante Nocturno

**HOSTAL DEL VALLE, CATALAN PYRENEES**
**DECEMBER 22, 2018**
**12:15 AM**

Darkness was not merely an absence of light; it was a physical entity that had devoured the lobby hours ago. Four hours, to be exact, since the antenna collapsed and the valley's electrical grid drew its last breath, leaving the Hostal del Valle plunged into an abyssal gloom.

Elena Vives adjusted her flashlight beam, watching how dust motes danced in the cone of white light, suspended like dead stars in a miniature galaxy. The cold was no longer a warning, but a tenant that had settled deep in her bones. She rubbed her arms over her technical jacket, feeling the futile friction against the waterproof fabric. The building's silence was absolute, broken only by the distant groan of the wooden structure resisting the assault of the external wind.

Lucas Riera stood by the main entrance, a silhouette cut against the shadows. His posture was rigid, his right hand resting instinctively on the holster of his weapon at his waist. The limp in his right leg was accentuated by the drop in temperature, forcing him to shift his weight from one foot to the other with an almost hypnotic rhythm.

"Did you hear that?" Lucas asked. His voice sounded raspy, devoid of echo in the vastness of the room furnished with leather sofas and Persian rugs that now looked like inkblots.

Elena nodded, though he couldn't see her outside the light's radius.
"Knocking."

It wasn't the wind. The White Beast, as the locals called the storm, howled and scratched, but this was rhythmic. Deliberate. Urgent.

*Thump. Thump. Thump.*

Someone was pounding on the solid wood of the main door with the desperation of one who knows time has run out.

Lucas stepped forward. His police flashlight beam cut through the blackness, illuminating the wrought-iron bolts. Elena followed him, the scalpel she had put in her pocket weighing like a moral anchor; a precision tool in a world that was becoming too crude.

"Step back, Elena," the policeman ordered. There was no doubt in his tone, only the authority of one accustomed to interposing himself between danger and civilians.

Lucas slid the top bolt. The metal screeched, a sharp sound that seemed to tear through the lobby's frozen air. As soon as he turned the knob, nature reclaimed its space.

The door burst open, pushed by an invisible, violent force. The blizzard erupted into the lobby like an explosion of ground glass. The wind howled, extinguishing the sepulchral silence and casting a horizontal curtain of snow that momentarily blinded Elena. The cold, until then passive, turned aggressive, biting into every inch of exposed skin.

A figure collapsed inward, falling onto the slate tiles with the dull thud of a sack of frozen meat.

Lucas struggled with the door, pushing with his shoulder and wincing in pain when his bad leg protested, until he managed to close it again, silencing the storm's roar to a menacing murmur.

Elena was already on her knees beside the newcomer. She focused her flashlight.

It was a man. Or what was left of one.

He wore a navy-blue anorak with the valley maintenance company's logo, torn at the shoulder. His face was a mask of cerulean horror; his skin had that grayish, translucent tone of old wax. Frost had welded itself to his eyelashes and three-day beard, creating an ice crust that gave him an unreal, almost sculptural appearance.

"Lucas, help me!" Elena cried, instinctively searching for a pulse in the carotid artery. Her own hand trembled, but her fingers found the man's skin hard as marble. "He's hypothermic!"

The policeman knelt on the other side, illuminating the body.
"It's Miquel. The antenna technician."

Miquel opened his eyes. There were no pupils, just two dilated wells staring into a terrifying infinity. His lips, cracked and blue, moved without emitting a sound, like a fish out of water gasping for oxygen.

Elena brought her ear close to the man's mouth. She felt his breath, faint and carrying that sweet, metallic odor that precedes the end.
"Miquel, look at me," she demanded, using her professional tone, that voice designed to anchor victims to reality. "You're in the hotel. You're safe."

The technician's body convulsed. It wasn't a shiver from the cold, but the final spasm of a collapsing nervous system. His gloved, stiff hand awkwardly rose to clutch Elena's lapel. The strength of the grip surprised her; it was pure desperation turned into motor action.

"No..." he croaked. The word emerged wrapped in a cloud of vapor. "Not... safe."

Elena searched for visible injuries. Aside from the evident frostbite, she saw bruises on his neck, purple marks that were not the work of the cold, but of human fingers. Someone had held him tightly.

"What happened, Miquel? Who did this to you?" Lucas asked, drawing so close that his flashlight illuminated the dying man's dilated nostrils.

The man coughed, a wet, cavernous sound. Dark blood welled from the corner of his lips, staining the melted snow on the floor.
"The... light..." he whispered, his voice broken like trampled dry leaves. "It saw me."

Elena felt a knot in her stomach, a physical pressure that made it hard to breathe. The light in the forest. The one they had seen from the window before coming down.

"Who saw you?" she insisted, wiping the blood with her sleeve, a useless but human gesture.

Miquel fixed his gaze on the dark ceiling, or perhaps beyond, piercing through the concrete and wood to the overcast sky. His eyes filled with a sudden and terrible lucidity, that final clarity sometimes granted by the last few seconds.

"The Sculptor..." he said, and this time the word was clear, crisp, a death sentence. "He's... in the basement."

The revelation fell upon them with more weight than the hotel's darkness. Elena froze. The basement. Beneath their feet. In the very structure where they sought refuge.

The grip on Elena's lapel loosened. Miquel's hand fell to the floor with a dry thud. The air left his lungs in a long, definitive sigh, taking with it the last spark of heat he had left. His eyes remained fixed, glassy, forever capturing the terror of whatever he had seen in the blackness.

Lucas let out a choked curse and ran a hand over his face, rubbing his eyes hard. "Damn it."

Elena pulled back slowly, crawling backward until her back hit the leg of an armchair. She looked at her hands. Miquel's blood was on her sleeve and the sensation of his death was impregnated in her skin.

"He's dead," she declared. It wasn't a question. It was the clinical confirmation of an irreversible fact.

Silence reclaimed the lobby, but now it held a different quality. It was no longer a void. Now it was inhabited. Inhabited by a corpse at their feet and by a threat breathing beneath them.

Lucas stood up, ignoring the pain in his leg. He shined his light down the hallway that led to the kitchens and, beyond, to the service stairs. The beam of light was lost in the blackness, unable to dispel the fear that had just germinated.

"He said the basement," the policeman murmured, fully drawing his weapon and flicking off the safety with a metallic click that echoed like a gunshot. "Elena, get your gear."

The woman nodded, picking up her flashlight from the floor. Her fingers brushed against the man's watch on her wrist, its mechanical ticking inaudible yet present against her accelerated pulse. The blizzard continued to batter the walls, trapping them in a tomb of ice and stone, but the true danger was no longer outside.

They had let death in, but the killer was already inside.

## Chapter 12: Descenso al Inframundo

**Aigüestortes, Boí Valley**
**December 22, 2018**

The service door, located behind the reception desk, gave way with a groan of swollen wood that shattered the sepulchral silence of the lobby. Lucas moved first, his service weapon extended and the beam of his flashlight cutting through the density of the suspended dust. His right leg, stiff from the atmospheric pressure change brought by the storm, dragged slightly over the tiles, producing a rhythmic hiss, painful to hear.

Elena followed him, clutching her camera with white knuckles. The air there smelled different from the metallic stench of blood they had left behind with Matías's corpse; down here, the atmosphere had the stale taste of stagnant dampness and a chemical undertone, similar to camphor, that stung her throat.

"Mind the stairs," Lucas murmured. His voice echoed off the narrow walls, distorted, as if the building wanted to swallow his words.

The descent was not a simple drop into a storage room. The staircase curved into a narrow spiral, carved into the living rock of the mountain on which the hotel stood. With every step they took, the already freezing temperature dropped another degree. Elena felt the cold pierce through the layers of her technical clothing, searching for the warmth of her vital organs like an invisible parasite. She brought her left hand to her chest, grazing the face of her father's watch, seeking in its mechanical ticking an anchor against the claustrophobia that was beginning to close its claws around her neck.

The exposed brick walls gave way to irregular granite blocks, enormous and primal.

"Stop," she whispered, stopping abruptly.

Lucas turned his body, sweeping the wall with his light.

"What do you see?"

Elena approached the stone surface. It wasn't empty. Someone, a long time ago, had used charcoal or a sharp tool to mark the rock. These were not the urban graffiti she was accustomed to in city alleyways, nor the signatures of bored teenagers.

They were diagrams. Geometric lines that overlapped with frenetic strokes. Elena traced one of the lines with her gloved finger. There were dates, some from the early twentieth century, and phrases in bastard Latin, written in a spiky, furious script. *Natura non facit saltus*. Nature makes no leaps. And below, more recent, almost fresh: *Perfectionis*.

"It looks like a record," Elena said, photographing the wall. The flash exploded, revealing for a fraction of a second the magnitude of the inscriptions: they covered the entire descending passageway, a tapestry of obsession carved in stone. "Or a countdown."

"Whatever it is, it's not Matías's," Lucas resumed walking, but his grip on the pistol had tightened. "This has been here for years."

The passageway abruptly opened into a vast cavern, and Lucas's beam of light got lost in the blackness before finding the ceiling. The sound of their footsteps changed; it was no longer the dry thud on stone, but a hollow, resonant echo, suggesting a cathedral-like vastness.

Elena raised her own flashlight, sweeping the space. Her breath hitched.

They were not in a conventional basement. Before them unfolded a colonnade of semicircular arches, worn by centuries but unmistakable. The floor was covered with fractured mosaics where blue and white tesserae formed wave patterns.

"Good God..." Lucas exhaled, lowering his weapon out of sheer disbelief.

In the center of the subterranean chamber, an immense rectangular pool dominated the space. There was no liquid water. The surface was a slab of black ice, perfectly smooth, reflecting their distorted silhouettes like macabre funhouse mirrors.

"Thermae," Elena deduced, her profiler's mind piecing together the architectural elements. "The hotel was built over ancient Roman baths. That's why they called it 'Sanatorium.' They took advantage of the medicinal waters..."

"Until they froze over," Lucas completed, illuminating the edge of the pool.

The discovery added a layer of oppressive antiquity to the place. They were treading on a forgotten stratum of history, a place designed for healing that now resembled a tomb. The mist of their breaths mingled in the static air.

A noise from the back, something like plastic scraping against stone, made Lucas raise his weapon again.

"Is anyone there?" he shouted. The echo returned his own voice multiplied: *there, there, there*.

No one answered, but Elena's flashlight caught a group of figures on the other side of the frozen pool, clustered in a corner, in the gloom.

There were five. Perhaps six. They stood, motionless, with limbs at unnatural angles.

"Lucas..." Elena felt a pang in her stomach, a sudden nausea that had nothing to do with the smell.

"Stay here."

"No."

They advanced together, circling the perimeter of the ice. The crunch of their boots sounded like gunshots in that mausoleum silence. As they drew closer, the figures gained definition. Pale skin, gleaming under the artificial light. Naked torsos.

Elena braced herself to see cadaverous faces, the empty expression of death that she knew so well. But when the beam of light fully illuminated the group, the reality was more grotesque than the expectation.

They weren't people; nor were they simple store mannequins. They were antique anatomical models, the kind used in medical schools decades ago. They were ravaged. One was missing its lower jaw, violently ripped off, revealing a rusted spring mechanism. Another had its torso ripped open, not with a surgeon's precision, but with an animal's fury, exposing painted plastic organs that dangled like rotten fruit.

They were arranged in a circle, as if holding a silent conclave.

Elena approached the tallest one. Its head was turned one hundred eighty degrees, facing its own back. On its fiberglass chest, someone had used a scalpel to carve into the synthetic material. This time, it wasn't words, but deep cuts, incisions mimicking surgical wounds.

"He was practicing," Elena whispered, feeling bile rise in her throat. The repulsion was physical, visceral. "It's not art. It's rehearsal."

Lucas illuminated the floor around the mannequins. There were fragments of synthetic 'skin' scattered everywhere, and among them, real tools. A rib spreader. Bent hemostatic forceps.

"Rehearsal for what?" the officer asked, though his tone suggested he'd rather not know the answer.

"To preserve," she replied, looking at the glass eyes of a child mannequin that watched her from the floor. "Or to correct what he deems imperfect."

Lucas's flashlight flickered once. Then twice. The battery, affected by the extreme cold, was beginning to die. The darkness at the back of the chamber, where the thermae extended into even deeper tunnels, seemed to advance a step toward them, reclaiming its territory.

## Chapter 13: Fracturas Internas

**Aigüestortes, December 22, 2018**
**Dawn**

The ascent from the depths of the hot springs had been a silent pilgrimage, a procession of two souls carrying the weight of a truth too great to be shared beneath the artificial light of the lobby. The night had dissolved not in a burst of sun, but in a degradation from black to dirty gray, that specific hue of damp ash that announces the outside world has ceased to exist.

Elena Vives watched the steam rising from her empty cup. Her hands, clutching the cheap ceramic, sought a warmth that the hotel's heating system could no longer guarantee. The industrial kitchen was a vast mausoleum of stainless steel and white tiles, a place designed for culinary noise and chaos, now reduced to a liturgical silence, broken only by the asthmatic hum of a dying refrigerator.

She wore her father's watch on her left wrist. The second hand advanced with a cadence that echoed in her temples, a constant hammering against the bone. *Tick*. A life. *Tock*. A death. The crescent-shaped scar on her palm itched, a phantom reminder that danger lay not only in the mutilated mannequins in the basement, but in the static tension that filled the room.

Lucas Riera stood by the frame of the service door, his shoulders propped against the wood as if he were holding up the building's structure by sheer will. His right leg, the bad one, barely grazed the floor; he shifted his weight to the left with a naturalness rehearsed over years of concealing weakness. His eyes, two dark coffee wells clouded by insomnia, swept the space, watching the entrances.

Before them, the hotel staff gathered like a frightened flock anticipating the wolf's imminence.

The manager, a man named Vallés whose bald head gleamed with a fine sheen of perspiration despite the cold, wiped his forehead with a crumpled handkerchief. Beside him, Marta, the angular-faced chambermaid, and Bernat, the burly cook with reddened hands, exchanged glances that needed no verbal translation. Fear has a universal language: dilated pupils and short breaths.

"The situation is unsustainable," Vallés said, his voice trembling, devoid of the feigned authority he usually displayed at the reception desk. "The road is still blocked. The radio is dead. And now… this."

Elena looked up. She met no one's gaze; she focused on the manager's jugular, watching how his pulse hammered wildly beneath the flaccid skin. 110 beats per minute. Contained panic.

"This?" Lucas asked. His voice was low, like sandpaper grinding against stone.

Bernat stepped forward. His apron, usually spotless, showed stains of old grease. He turned towards the large cold room at the back of the space, a metallic beast with a heavy door.

"I went to prepare breakfast," the cook growled. There was a mix of disbelief and fury in his tone. "Rationing, as you said. Something warm to keep spirits up."

He walked towards the dry pantry, an adjoining room with metal shelves, and swung the door wide open. The gesture was theatrical, violent.

Emptiness stared back at them.

It wasn't a total absence, which would have been less disturbing. It was a surgical removal. The canned goods were gone, the cured meats, the boxes of energy foods, the chocolate, the high-proof alcohol. Only open sacks of flour, useless spices, and paper napkins remained. The gaps on the shelves looked like teeth ripped from a diseased mouth.

"When?" The question left Elena's lips before she could filter it. Her analytical mind was already drawing timelines, calculating volumes and escape routes.

The sound of her voice seemed to act as a trigger. Heads turned towards her in unison, a movement choreographed by suspicion.

"Everything was here last night," Marta spat, crossing her arms as if to protect her vital organs. "I locked up myself before going up to the rooms."

"The lock isn't forced," Lucas pointed out, approaching to examine the frame. His calloused fingers ran over the metal without finding any scratches. "Whoever did it either had a key or knew how to bypass the bolt."

"Or perhaps they never went to sleep," Bernat said. The cook turned towards Elena, and his massive body seemed to expand, taking up more space than he was entitled to. "Perhaps someone has been wandering around the hotel while the rest of us tried to rest."

The atmosphere shifted. The temperature in the kitchen seemed to drop ten degrees at once. It was no longer a meeting of survivors; it was an impromptu tribunal.

Elena felt that familiar pressure in her chest, the claw of emotional claustrophobia closing over her lungs. *Don't react*, she commanded herself. *Observe*.

Bernat's knuckles were white. Vallés stared at the floor, unable to endure the confrontation, an accomplice by omission. Marta looked at her with a contempt that went beyond logic; it was the atavistic rejection of the tribe towards the outsider who brings misfortune.

"You've been here two days," the cook continued, stepping towards the table where Elena was sitting. "Ever since you arrived, everything's gone to hell. First the storm, then the noises, now the food."

"That's absurd," Elena said, maintaining a neutral, almost clinical tone. "Physically, I couldn't have moved that amount of provisions alone and without making noise. Besides, where would I hide it? In my room?"

"You have that backpack," Marta interjected, pointing to the mountain gear resting at the foot of Elena's chair. "And yesterday you went down to the basement. Nobody goes down to the basement. It's forbidden. What were you doing there? Hiding what you stole from us?"

The accusation lacked foundation, but in situations of extreme stress, truth is irrelevant; the only thing that matters is finding a culprit to channel the terror. Elena was the perfect scapegoat: distant, strange, a stranger to the valley.

"I was investigating," Elena replied. Her green eyes, the color of frozen moss, fixed on Marta. "And what's down there is much worse than a few missing cans of tuna. You should be worried about…"

"Don't come to us with city tales!" Bernat shouted, striking the steel table with an open hand. The clang echoed like a gunshot, making the crockery vibrate. "We want to know where the food is! I have children at home I don't know when I'll see, and I'm not going to starve to death because of some snobby woman from Barcelona playing detective!"

The cook advanced another step. His invasion of Elena's personal space was a blatant aggression. His body's shadow fell over her, eclipsing the pale light from the window. Elena tensed, her muscles preparing for flight or fight, adrenaline flooding her bloodstream with the metallic taste of ancient fear.

"Bernat, back away," Lucas warned from the pantry.

"You shut up, Riera," the man snapped, blinded by rage. "Always protecting outsiders. Are you screwing the…?"

The movement was a blur.

Lucas didn't run; his limp prevented it. But the speed of his reaction didn't lie in his legs, but in the explosive fury he had been containing. In two long, uneven strides, he placed himself between the cook and the table.

He didn't draw his weapon. He didn't need to.

Lucas grabbed Bernat by the lapel of his apron and shoved him back with a dry, brutal violence. The cook, despite his size, stumbled and crashed into the marble countertop, knocking over a stack of trays that fell with a tortured clatter of metal.

The police chief didn't stop there. He lunged into the space he had just created, cornering the other man. His face was inches from Bernat's. The veins in his neck stood out like cords beneath his skin.

"I said back away!" Lucas roared.

His voice was not that of a neighbor, nor a friend. It was the voice of broken authority, of a man who has seen the abyss and has no patience for human pettiness. The echo of the shout bounced off the tiles, silencing even the refrigerator's hum.

Marta let out a small gasp and clapped a hand over her mouth. Vallés stumbled back until he hit the wall, pale as wax.

Lucas was breathing heavily. The pain in his leg must have been agonizing after the sudden exertion, but he stood tall, a tower of protection between the mob and the woman sitting at the table.

"No one has stolen anything for themselves," Lucas said, lowering his voice but maintaining a lethal intensity. "Whoever took the food doesn't want to eat. They want us to starve. They want us to weaken. They want us to fight among ourselves like animals."

He slowly turned towards the group, releasing Bernat, who was rubbing his chest, dazed by the force of the shove.

"Elena was with me," Lucas lied, or at least, he omitted the part where they had briefly separated. "And what we saw downstairs… Believe me, she's not the problem. The problem is that we're not alone in this hotel."

A thick, almost solid silence settled in the kitchen. The accusation against Elena had dissolved, replaced by a latent hostility, colder and more dangerous. The group had fractured. They were no longer six people trapped by the snow. They were two sides: Lucas and Elena against the rest.

Elena slowly stood up. Her legs trembled, but her face remained impassive, a mask of cracked porcelain. She picked up her empty cup.

"Thanks for the trust," she said, her voice sharp as the wind howling outside the window. "If you'll excuse me, I have work to do before the light fades."

She left the kitchen without looking back, feeling the weight of hateful and fearful stares on the back of her neck. Lucas stayed for another second, holding his ground, making sure no one followed her, before limping after her.

The fracture was made. And through the crack, the cold began to seep in.

## Chapter 14: El Diario del Dr. F.

**Aigüestortes, December 22, 2018**
**Room 204**

The ascent from the kitchens was a pilgrimage through a dense, almost liquid silence. Elena Vives climbed the three flights of stairs, feeling the wood creak under her boots with a sound that recalled fracturing bones. She left behind the chaos of the ransacked pantry, the staff's mute accusations, and Lucas's wounded-dog look. She needed isolation. Her mind, that machine trained to categorize horror, demanded a sterile environment to process the next piece of the puzzle.

Upon entering Room 204, the stale air hit her with the smell of confinement and dampness. She closed the door and threw the bolt. It wasn't enough. She dragged the heavy oak chair and wedged it under the doorknob, building a physical barricade against a fear that was, in essence, invisible.

She pulled off her gloves with her teeth, anxious, and sat on the edge of the unmade bed. From her backpack, she extracted the object that burned through the fabric: the black leather-bound diary she had taken days earlier. The cover's leather was cracked, resembling the texture of an elderly hand left exposed to the elements.

She turned on the bedside lamp. The bulb flickered, struggling against the electrical storm besieging the valley, and cast long, convulsive shadows on the walls.

Elena opened the diary.

The smell of mold and formaldehyde rose from the pages, an olfactory mix that activated in her brain the muscle memory of morgues and autopsy rooms. She didn't read immediately. First, she observed the handwriting. It was a spiky script, slanted to the right with a manic aggression, where the accent marks looked like daggers on the page.

"Let's see who you were," she whispered, and her own voice sounded strange in the gloom.

She turned past the first pages, filled with dates from 1948. The author, who signed only with a stylized F, didn't write standard medical logs. They were manifestos.

"The corruption of flesh is biology's original sin. Heat is the enemy. In heat, bacteria thrive, tissues soften, morals dissolve. Heat is accelerated putrefaction."

A tightness settled in her temples. He wasn't a doctor seeking to cure tuberculosis; he was a fanatic obsessed with stopping time. She continued reading, her green eyes scanning paragraphs where scientific terminology mingled with mystical delusions.

"I have observed that ice does not destroy. Ice purifies. It suspends decay. My patients do not die in the snow; they transcend their own mortality. By lowering the body temperature below twenty-five degrees, the soul crystallizes, unblemished, perfect for eternity."

Eugenics. The word floated in Elena's mind, heavy as a tombstone. Dr. F. believed he was ‘saving’ his patients through methodical freezing.

An uninvited memory assailed Elena, violent and sudden. She wasn't in the hotel anymore. She was back in the Aragonese Pyrenees, six months ago. The case that broke her. She saw the face of that child, pale and bluish, preserved under a layer of morning frost. The static beauty of death that so horrified the living and which, it seemed, fascinated the author of this diary. Her breathing became shallow. Her chest tightened as if iron ribs were squeezing her from the outside.

"Focus," she ordered herself, digging her nails into the palm of her left hand, right over the crescent-shaped scar. The sharp pain served as an anchor.

She returned to the diary. She turned a page and paused at a detailed anatomical drawing with an almost obscene precision. It showed a human body submerged in what looked like an immersion tub, with notes on the freezing times for each organ. The liver resisted longer than the kidneys. The brain had to be cooled first to preserve the ‘essence.’

And then, she reached the list.

It occupied the last pages, written with that antique fountain pen. The header read: *CANDIDATES FOR THE MAGNUM OPUS*.

They weren't names of sick patients. They were descriptions of traits.
"Subject 1: Male, robust build, perfect facial symmetry. High pain resistance."
"Subject 4: Female, fertile age, light hair. Aesthetic purity is vital for preservation."

Elena understood with a vertiginous nausea that the Sanatorium hadn't been a hospital, but a macabre art studio where the materials were flesh and bone, and the chisel was absolute cold. The ‘Sculptor’ who now hunted them wasn't just any imitator; he was a disciple, a perpetuator of this frozen theology.

Her fingers turned the page with a tremor. The paper crackled, dry and brittle.

In the right margin of the last page, the texture of the handwriting changed.

It was no longer the sepia and faded ink of 1948. There was no oxidation of time in the strokes. It was blue ink, bright, chemical. Modern ballpoint ink. A recent addition, scribbled with such force that it had embossed the paper.

Elena brought the diary closer to the light, refusing to accept what her retinas were sending to her brain. Her heart pounded against her sternum with the violence of a trapped bird.

There, among the notes from seventy years ago, was a new list. Three names crossed out with a furious line. And below, the only intact name, written with handwriting that denoted possession and hunger.

*Elena Vives*.

Next to her name, a note in the same vibrant blue: *‘Intellectual symmetry. The centerpiece. Ready for collection.’*

She dropped the diary as if it were a burning ember. The notebook fell to the floor with a dull thud, lying open on that accusing page.

Elena backed up until she hit the cold wall of the room. Reality fractured. She wasn't there to solve a crime. She wasn't the hunter chasing a beast in the mountains. All this time, since she received the first letter, since she set foot in this cursed valley, she had been nothing more than livestock willingly walking into the slaughterhouse.

The wind howled outside, rattling the windowpanes, but the true cold, the one Dr. F. promised would purify the soul, had just settled into her own blood.

The enemy didn't just know who she was. It had been waiting for her for decades.

## Chapter 15: Avalancha

Aigüestortes, December 22, 2018
Noon

The valley wasn't silent; it held its breath.

Lucas Riera adjusted the collar of his parka, feeling the synthetic fabric scrape against the three-day stubble shadowing his face. The air had a metallic taste, like an old coin sucked under the tongue, a taste that preceded snowfalls erasing paths and rewriting geography. But this wasn't just meteorology. It was an artificial stillness, tense, like a violin string stretched to its breaking point.

His right leg, the one burdened with the memory of old injuries and the secret of a degenerative diagnosis he hid from the world, throbbed with a dull rhythm. It was his personal barometer. The pain wasn't sharp, but a constant pressure, a reminder that time was slipping away from him, not just in the investigation, but in life.

"I don't like the look of those cornices, Chief," said Marc, one of the village volunteers. The young man, barely a twenty-something with a face reddened by the biting wind, pointed towards the western ridge of the peak rising above the hotel.

Lucas followed the direction of his finger. The mountain leaned over them with the arrogance of an ancient god. Large accumulations of unstable snow hung like marble balconies about to give way.

"Keep people away from the northern perimeter," Lucas ordered, his voice hoarse, swallowed by the white immensity. "If that falls, it won't give any warning."

"Do you think it will hold until the snowplow arrives?"

Lucas didn't answer immediately. He observed the sky, a flat, gray mantle, without nuances, that seemed to have descended to crush the tops of the fir trees. There were no birds. There was no wind. Only that unbearable wait.

"No one is coming, Marc. We're alone."

The statement wasn't meant to be cruel, just honest. Lucas turned towards the facade of the old sanatorium converted into a luxury hotel. The building, an imposing structure of stone and wood, looked like an intruder in that realm of ice. On the second floor, a window reflected the leaden light of the day. Room 204.

Elena was there.

Thinking of her caused an involuntary contraction in his stomach. The professional admiration he felt for the profiler had mutated, quickly and dangerously, into a territory he couldn't afford to explore. She was a woman made of broken glass and sharp edges, seeking patterns in chaos, while he was a man trying to maintain order as his own body crumbled.

He took a step towards the main entrance, intending to regroup the volunteers in the lobby, when the world shattered.

It wasn't a roar at first. It was a snap. Dry. Violent. Unnatural.

*Crack.*

The sound reverberated through the valley with the clarity of a rifle shot, but magnified a thousand times. It wasn't the lazy creak of melting ice. It was a detonation.

Lucas stopped dead, his police instinct screaming before his brain processed the visual information. *Explosives*. Someone had detonated a charge on the ridge.

"Run!" the cry tore from his throat. "Inside! Everyone inside!"

He looked up. What he saw froze his blood faster than any blizzard. The mountaintop seemed to dissolve. The cornice Marc had pointed out was no longer a solid structure; it had transformed into a liquid wall, a wave of white foam and fury beginning to descend, devouring the hillside.

Gravity did the rest. Tons of snow, ice, and rock rushed down towards the valley, gaining speed with every meter, becoming an amorphous beast that obliterated the forest in its path. Centuries-old trees exploded like toothpicks before the mass's thrust.

From the window of Room 204, Elena Vives watched the end of the world.

She held the doctor's diary in one hand, the other pressed against the cold glass. Her mind, trained to dissect static crime scenes, struggled to process the kinetic violence unfolding before her moss-colored eyes. There was no beauty in that destruction, only a brutal, indifferent, and colossal force.

She made out the tiny figures below. Black dots on a white canvas. Among them, she distinguished Lucas.

She recognized him by his posture, by that way he shifted his weight onto his left leg. He was pushing others towards the doors, gesticulating, shouting words that the double glazing silenced.

"Lucas!" she cried, hitting the glass with an open palm, a useless, absurd gesture.

The white tide, a leviathan's tongue, reached the forest's edge and lunged at the hotel clearing. Elena recoiled, stumbling over the chair blocking the door, her heart hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird.

Below, time dilated. For Lucas, every second stretched into an eternity of hyper-realistic details. He perceived pure terror in Marc's eyes as the young man lunged into the lobby. He noticed how the pulverized snow, the 'aerosol' preceding the avalanche, obscured the sun, turning noon into twilight.

He tried to run. His brain sent the order to his legs, demanding speed, power, escape. But his right knee gave way. A sharp jab, like a burning nail, made him stumble.

He wouldn't make it to the door.

Understanding came with a strange calm. There was no panic, just an arithmetic acceptance of distance and speed.

He turned, turning his back on the white death bearing down on him, and threw himself into the recess protected by one of the stone buttresses of the entrance, covering his head with his arms.

The impact wasn't sound; it was pressure.

The world turned white, then gray, and finally, absolutely black.

The building groaned. The hotel's structure, designed to withstand rigorous winters but not the direct assault of the entire mountain, shook to its foundations. The roar was deafening, a cacophony of shattering glass, splintering wood, and twisting metal.

The snow didn't enter the lobby; it invaded it. It smashed the ground-floor windows as if they were made of sugar paper, inundating the reception, the lounge, and the corridors. The force of the avalanche dragged furniture, lamps, and works of art in a torrent of frozen debris.

Then, the lights flickered once. Twice. And died.

The mountain's roar ceased as abruptly as it had begun, leaving behind a dense, heavy silence, an acoustic void that hummed in the ears.

Elena lay on the floor of her room, hands over her head, breathing in dust and fear. The floor had stopped vibrating. She slowly pushed herself up, her muscles trembling from the adrenaline rush. The light coming through her window was diffused, sickly.

She approached the glass, or what remained of the view.

Below, there was nothing. The main entrance, the porch where Lucas had been moments ago, the access road... everything had vanished under an uneven blanket of dirty snow, mixed with branches and stones. The snow was piled halfway up the first-floor windows.

"Lucas..." the name left her lips like a broken prayer.

Beneath the surface, reality was very different.

Lucas Riera was alive, but he didn't know for how long.

He woke, or regained consciousness, in absolute darkness. He couldn't move. He felt an oppressive weight on his chest, an invisible slab preventing him from expanding his lungs beyond short, shallow breaths.

Panic, a reptilian creature, tried to take control. *I'm buried. I'm going to die here.*

*No.*

He forced his mind to work. He was a cop. He was a man of procedures. Step one: Assess.

He couldn't feel his legs, but he could slightly move the fingers of his right hand inside his glove. His mouth was full of icy grit. He spat, coughing, and the effort cost him a sharp pain in his ribs.

The cold wasn't ambient; it was direct physical contact. The snow enveloped him like a rapidly setting plaster mold. He knew, from mountain rescue training, that avalanche snow hardens like cement within minutes once the movement stops.

He had to move. Now.

He tried to arch his back. Nothing. He was immobilized. Claustrophobia began to close his throat, more effective than any human hand. The image of an ice tomb, perfect, immaculate, flashed through his mind. The 'Sculptor's' dream. Was this how it ended? Turned into a statue under the snow?

*Elena needs you.*

The thought was a lash. If he died, she would be helpless with the killer. Defenseless in a hotel that was now a death trap.

Anger gave him the strength that fear denied him. He grunted, an animal sound in the darkness, and pushed with his whole body, ignoring the pain in his leg, disregarding the lack of air. He felt something give way to his left. A void.

He was near the building wall. The buttress. If there was an air pocket, it was there.

He freed an arm, scratching at the compacted snow with desperation. His fingernails, protected by leather gloves, scraped against something hard. Stone. He followed the wall upwards. The snow was looser in that direction.

He dug relentlessly until his shoulder muscles burned. Snow fell on his face, seeping down his neck, melting against his skin hot from the effort, but he kept pushing towards what he hoped was the surface.

His hand broke through the crust of ice and found emptiness.

Air. Icy air, but breathable.

Lucas emerged from the snow like a castaway from a solid ocean, gasping, coughing violently. He dragged himself to a sitting position on the white debris, wiping his eyes.

The sight was Dantean.

He found himself inside the lobby, or what was left of it. The avalanche had blown out the main facade and filled the ground floor almost to the ceiling. He was sitting on a mountain of snow that reached the hall's chandeliers. He could touch the ceiling with his hand if he stretched.

He looked around, searching for the others.

"Marc?" his voice sounded weak, absorbed by the muted acoustics of the snow.

A movement to his right. An arm emerged from the whiteness. Lucas dragged himself over, his legs sinking into the unstable snow, and pulled. He helped the young volunteer out, trembling and pale, with a nasty cut on his forehead that was bleeding profusely, staining the snow a brilliant crimson.

"Chief..." Marc stammered, his teeth chattering. "What... what happened?"

"They've trapped us," Lucas murmured, looking towards where the reception desk should have been.

Everything was buried. The counter, the switchboard, the access to the basements.

The basements.

A new wave of horror struck Lucas.

"The generator room," he said, the word escaping with a cloud of vapor. "The emergency generators are on the lower level."

Marc followed his gaze. There was only compacted snow blocking the descending stairs. Tons of it.

The hotel was dark. No electricity. No heating. In the midst of a storm promising twenty below zero temperatures. And the only source of power was buried under ten meters of triggered avalanche.

Lucas looked towards the main staircase, which miraculously still stood, ascending from the mountain of snow into the darkness of the upper floors.

Upstairs, on the first-floor railing, he saw a figure silhouetted against the gloom. The unmistakable glint of a man's watch on a slender wrist.

His eyes met Elena's. There was no relief in her gaze, only a terrifying understanding of the new reality.

It was no longer about solving a crime. Now, the game had changed. The board had been overturned.

The killer didn't just want to kill Elena. He intended to freeze them all. To turn the entire hotel into his masterpiece, his ice mausoleum. And he had just laid the first stone.

Lucas looked at his hands. Large, calloused, trembling uncontrollably, not from the cold, but from fury. He clenched his fists until his knuckles turned white.

They were trapped in the belly of the white beast. And the temperature was starting to drop.

## Chapter 16: Hipoxia

**Aigüestortes, Lleida Pyrenees**
**December 22, 2018**

The silence after the roar weighed heavier than the rubble. It wasn't an absence of sound, but a physical pressure in her eardrums, a dense substance that replaced the air in Elena Vives's lungs.

From the first-floor railing, she observed the hotel's new geography. The lobby had ceased to exist. Where Persian rugs and leather armchairs once stood, now stretched a white dune, compact and violent, which had burst through the main doors and devoured the reception area. The snow wasn't the innocent powder of postcards; it was frozen concrete, soiled with splinters and pulverized glass.

Masonry dust floated in the anemic beams of light that filtered through the upper cracks, dancing like specters over the ground floor's grave.

“Lucas?” her voice sounded alien, raspy, as if she had swallowed sand.

A movement under the main staircase's arch broke the stillness. A figure emerged from the side gloom, shaking a layer of plaster from his shoulders. Lucas Riera coughed, a cavernous sound that echoed through the building's hollow structure.

Elena felt the knot in her diaphragm loosen, only to tighten again as she watched him walk. The police chief limped forward, dragging his right leg with a stiffness that went beyond his old injury. Each step over the rubble was a negotiation with pain.

“Up. Everyone up. Now,” Lucas ordered. His tone brooked no argument, though he was out of breath.

Survivors began to emerge from the rooms along Elena's corridor. Doctor Arnald Soler, his pristine gray wool coat immaculate despite the chaos, adjusted his glasses with trembling hands. A young couple of guests clung to each other against the wall, eyes wide with terror, staring at the white void that had swallowed the exit.

Elena looked at her wristwatch, the large, masculine face that had belonged to her father. The hands pointed to twelve twenty-five. Time kept ticking, indifferent to the world having stopped.

“The structure is holding,” Elena said, forcing her mind into analytical mode. It was her defense mechanism: converting terror into data. If she analyzed, she didn’t feel. “But we’ve lost the heating. The generators were in the basement.”

Lucas reached the first-floor landing. His face was ashen, smudged with soot, and a line of dried blood crossed his forehead. He leaned against the wall, avoiding putting weight on his bad leg. Their gazes met. In his dark eyes, Elena read the confirmation of her worst fears: this had not been a natural accident. But Lucas remained silent. It wasn't the time.

“We need to take a headcount,” he said, panting slightly. “Who’s missing?”

“Everyone on this floor is accounted for,” Arnald replied, assuming a fragile authority. “The kitchen staff... they were downstairs.”

A deathly silence followed the declaration. No one needed to verbalize the fate of those on the ground floor. They were beneath tons of compacted snow.

“We can’t go down,” Elena took charge, her voice gaining firmness. “And no one is coming to look for us. The road must be wiped off the map.”

She walked to the end of the corridor. The cold was already starting to claim the building. Without the constant hum of the heating, the hotel was rapidly transforming into a stone freezer. The temperature dropped by the minute, an invisible tide numbing fingers and slowing thought.

“We need a shelter within the shelter,” Elena declared. She turned to the group. “The library. It’s the innermost room, it has a fireplace and double doors. We need to concentrate body heat.”

“And stay cooped up in there?” protested the man from the young couple, his voice cracking with hysteria. “We have to try to dig out, get out through a window!”

Lucas stepped forward, interposing his massive body between the young man’s panic and reality.

“If he opens a window, it will kill us all,” the policeman said. His right hand rested near his waist, where he kept his weapon, an unconscious gesture of control. “Outside it’s twenty degrees below zero and dropping. With this wind, the wind chill is lethal in minutes. The hotel is the only thing separating us from freezing to death.”

Elena nodded, validating the order.

“Gather everything that can burn. Books, wooden chairs, blankets from the rooms. Take all the food you find in the mini-bars to the library. Let’s go.”

The group dispersed with clumsy movements, stunned by the shock. Elena approached Lucas, lowering her voice to a harsh whisper.

“Your leg.”

“I’m fine,” he lied, clenching his jaw. Cold sweat beaded on his temple despite the decreasing temperature. “It’s just the knock.”

“Don’t lie to me, Riera. I need you whole.”

“I need you to keep these people sane, Elena. That’s what I need.”

They headed to the library. It was a spacious room, paneled in dark wood, with shelves that reached the ceiling. Arnald was already there, piling leather-bound volumes inside the large stone fireplace. The doctor acted with an automated efficiency, burning culture to buy survival.

When the fire caught, flames licking at the ancient pages, a false sense of security flooded the room. The six survivors huddled near the hearth. They closed the double doors and sealed them with rolled towels at the base to prevent drafts.

The heat began to rise, but with it, something else.

An hour passed. Then two.

Elena sat in a wingback armchair, reviewing the contents of her forensic kit. Scalpel, evidence bags, luminol. Useless tools to fight the cold. Suddenly, she felt a throbbing behind her eyes. A dull, rhythmic pain.

She looked up. The young woman was rubbing her temples. Lucas, leaning against the bookshelf, blinked heavily, as if his eyelids were made of lead. The fire, once vibrant, had taken on a lazy, orange hue.

The air.

Elena stood up abruptly, and the sudden movement made her dizzy, almost knocking her over. The world swayed.

“The fire,” Elena gasped. Her own voice sounded distant. “Put out the fire.”

“What are you saying?” Arnald looked at her with disbelief, holding another book. “We’ll freeze.”

“We’re suffocating!” she shouted, advancing toward the fireplace.

She grabbed the poker and scattered the burning books, stomping on the embers that rolled across the rug. Acrid smoke filled the room, making everyone cough.

“The room is airtight,” Elena explained, feeling adrenaline momentarily clear the fog from her brain. “We’ve sealed the entrances. The fire consumes oxygen faster than we do. We’re creating a gas chamber.”

Lucas reacted, limping toward the double doors. He tore the towels from the floor and swung the leaves wide open.

The corridor’s air, icy and sharp as a blade, invaded the library. It was a brutal blow, but it brought with it the gift of oxygen. The survivors greedily inhaled, coughing, as the room’s temperature plummeted in seconds.

The dilemma presented itself to them with the clarity of a death sentence.

Elena hugged herself, trembling. She looked at Lucas, then at Arnald and the rest. Their breaths formed white clouds every time they exhaled.

“If we close up and light the fire, we die of hypoxia,” Elena said, with the certainty of a forensic pathologist dictating the cause of death before it happens. “If we ventilate, we die of hypothermia.”

No one responded. The truth floated among them, invisible and toxic. They had to choose between breathing or warming up. They couldn't have both.

Lucas closed the doors, but this time he didn't seal them. He left a crack open. An invitation to the cold, the price to pay for staying conscious. He returned to Elena, his movements growing slower, weighed down by the pain he refused to admit.

“Shifts,” he said. “We’ll take shifts to monitor the ventilation. Ten minutes closed, two minutes open.”

They sat on the floor, in a circle, like a primitive tribe surrounding a fire they could no longer feed with joy. The afternoon light died in the windows, giving way to a bluish darkness that erased their faces.

In that moment, Elena understood the true nature of their prison. The Sculptor didn’t need a weapon. He only needed time and physics. The hotel wasn’t a refuge; it was an icy mausoleum waiting for its occupants to stop moving.

Silence fell upon them again, but this time it wasn’t empty. It was filled with synchronized breaths, the sound of chattering teeth, and the absolute certainty that the coming night would be the longest of their lives.

## Chapter 17: La Sombra en el Pasillo

**Hotel Aigüestortes, West Wing Hallway**
**December 22, 2018**

Leaving the relative safety of the library felt like shedding a second skin. I left behind the dying glow of the fireplace and Lucas, whose restless sleep filled the room with an unbearable fragility. I needed to move. Immobility was a breeding ground for the ghosts that haunted my memory, and tonight, the hotel seemed determined to summon them all.

The hallway stretched before me like the gullet of a dead beast. The cold here was different from outside; it didn't have the wind's fury, but the patience of ice seeping through the seams of mountaineering clothes. I turned on my flashlight. The beam of light cut through the darkness, revealing suspended dust particles dancing in the stagnant air, tiny satellites in a sealed universe.

My boots barely made a sound on the frayed carpet, but the building's silence was so absolute that even the rustle of my jacket sounded like a gunshot. I clutched the scalpel I had taken from the forensic kit in my pocket. The cold metal against my palm, just over the crescent-shaped scar, anchored me to reality.

Then I heard it.

It wasn't the creaking of the building settling under the weight of the snow, nor the groan of the beams contracting with the temperature. It was a rhythmic sound. Deliberate. The soft impact of a rubber sole against creaking wood, about twenty meters ahead, right where the corridor turned towards the service rooms.

I stopped dead in my tracks. My breath caught in my throat, a ball of ice I couldn't swallow or expel. Someone was walking. It wasn't Lucas; his limp dragged with a different rhythm. And Doctor Soler had been lightly snoring when I closed the library door.

I switched off my flashlight.

Darkness swallowed me instantly, dense and liquid. My pupils dilated, desperately searching for any nuance in the blackness. I sharpened my hearing, becoming pure perception.

*Creak. Crack.*

Footsteps. They receded, but without haste. It was the gait of someone who knows they own the ground, who isn't afraid of being discovered because they are the predator.

I forced myself to move forward. Every step required a negotiation with my survival instinct, which screamed at me to turn back and entrench myself by the fire. But the profiler who still lived in some corner of my brain, buried under layers of trauma and snow, took control. I needed to see. I needed to know what we were up against.

I moved forward, pressed against the wall, feeling the rough wallpaper beneath my fingertips. Reaching the corner, I peeked out with the caution of someone looking into an abyss.

A shadow stood out at the end of the hallway.

It was barely a silhouette, an absence of light deeper than its surroundings. Tall, indistinct. It stopped in front of the door to room 314. It didn't open it with a key, nor did it force it. It simply vanished inside, as if the wood were mist.

My heart hammered against my ribs with the violence of a caged bird. I crept forward, counting the seconds, calculating the distance. Fear transformed into an icy clarity. I was cornered.

I reached the door. It was ajar, barely a black sliver. I pushed the wood with my shoulder, switching on my flashlight and raising the scalpel in one fluid motion, ready to slash, to scream, to kill if necessary.

"Stay still!" my voice came out hoarse, a croak in the gloom.

The beam of light frantically swept the room. The bed was unmade, but empty. The wardrobe, open, showed bare hangers swaying slightly, like mocking pendulums.

No one.

I spun on my heels, illuminating every corner. Under the bed. Behind the heavy curtains that hid the storm outside. Nothing. It was impossible. I had seen him enter less than 10 seconds ago. The room had no balcony, and the windows were sealed by ice and the tempest.

Then, a metallic sound above my head stopped my search. A soft *click*, followed by a muffled scrape.

I raised my flashlight towards the ceiling. The ventilation duct grille was not in place. It hung from a single screw, swaying slightly. The black, rectangular opening stared back at me like an open maw.

I understood the architecture of our prison with renewed horror. The hotel wasn't just hallways and rooms; it had a hidden circulatory system. A network of metal tunnels where stale air traveled... and where he moved. While we were trapped on the surface, guarding the doors, the Sculptor crawled through the building's entrails, invisible, omnipresent. He could be anywhere. He could be above us right now, watching through the vents.

I lowered my gaze, dizzy from the revelation. My flashlight beam bounced off the dressing table mirror at the back of the room.

I approached, drawn by something that didn't fit the thermal logic of the place.

The glass was fogged. A patch of condensed mist in the center of the mirror, an island of warm breath in an ocean of cold. Someone had been there, standing before the reflection, exhaling their own life against the glass seconds before I entered.

And in the midst of that ephemeral cloud, a gloved finger had traced some words.

The condensation was already beginning to evaporate, devoured by the dryness of the freezing air. The letters lost their edges, turning into water, blurring before my eyes like a secret the universe refuses to keep.

I read the message just before the last vowel disappeared:

"You're making too much noise, Elena."

The mist completely dissipated, leaving me alone before my own reflection. My green eyes, wide and gleaming with panic, stared back at me from the glass. But I was no longer alone in that room. The sensation of being watched, not from a corner, but from above, from the walls, from the very air I breathed, lodged itself in the back of my neck.

It wasn't a hunt. It was a game. And he had just changed the rules.

## Chapter 18: Fiebre de Cabaña

**Aigüestortes, Catalan Pyrenees**
**December 23, 2018**

Dawn did not arrive like a promise, but like a grayish whisper, a corpse of light that barely managed to pierce the crust of ice accumulated on the library's windows.

I had returned to the common refuge shortly after my foray into the west wing, with terror still clinging to my skin like a second layer of thermal clothing. No one asked me where I had been; misery is a potent narcotic, and most of the guests were too busy trying not to freeze to notice my absence or return. I curled up in a corner, away from the mahogany shelves, hugging my knees, watching reality fray at the edges of the room.

The air had grown dense, almost chewable. It smelled of stale sweat, of damp clothes that never dried, and, beneath it all, the metallic tang of stagnant fear. The ventilation continued to spit out inadequate gusts of heat, but it brought something else with it: a constant hiss that burrowed into the eardrums, a low frequency that made teeth vibrate.

“They’re there…” a voice whispered to my left.

I turned my neck, feeling the stiffness of my vertebrae. He was a young man, perhaps thirty years old, wearing an electric blue anorak that now looked dull with grime. He stared fixedly at an empty spot on the wall, right where the wallpaper was peeling from the damp.

“Who?” I asked, more from inertia than curiosity.

“The birds,” he replied, without blinking, his pupils dilated to devour his irises. “They have fire in their beaks. They want to burn the books.”

I tensed. There were no birds. Only elongated shadows and the silence of the snow burying us alive. Hypoxia. Or perhaps carbon monoxide slowly seeping in, an invisible killer competing with the one hiding in the vents. “Mountain madness,” the locals called it. The mind, deprived of stimuli and subjected to perpetual cold, began to invent its own monsters so as not to feel so alone.

Across the room, a middle-aged woman rocked rhythmically, murmuring a lullaby to a velvet cushion. The group's cohesion, that fragile social glue that had kept us civilized for the first forty-eight hours, was evaporating. We were no longer people waiting for a rescue; we were caged animals measuring the thickness of the bars.

The trigger was absurd, as tragedies often are.

A blanket. A simple piece of Scottish wool, frayed at the edges, resting on the back of a wingback armchair.

The man in the blue anorak, the one who saw fire birds, rose with spasmodic movements. His hands, purple from the cold, closed around the fabric.

“It’s mine!” The shout ripped through the library's lethargic atmosphere.

There was no warning. A second man, burly and with a beard full of frost, lunged at him. The clash of bodies sounded hollow, unpleasant, flesh hitting bone without the cushioning of courtesy.

They rolled on the floor, knocking over a pile of encyclopedias that fell open, like dead birds with broken wings.

“Let it go, you thief!” bellowed the bearded man, throwing a clumsy punch that landed on the other’s ear.

Chaos erupted. The screams of the woman cradling the cushion joined the cacophony. Violence, contagious and primitive, electrified the air. I saw blood splatter the Persian rug, bright red drops that looked obscene against the dark fabric.

“Stop!” The command tried to assert itself, but it came out fractured.

Lucas Riera advanced from his position near the door. He moved poorly. The limp in his right leg was more pronounced today, a painful burden that robbed him of physical authority. His face was pale, waxy, and the weapon at his hip seemed a dead weight he had no intention of using.

He tried to grab the bearded man by the shoulder, but his grip lacked strength. The combatant thrashed with the fury of desperation and pushed the officer. Lucas stumbled, his boots slipped on an open encyclopedia, and he fell to one knee with a choked grunt that betrayed his fragility.

The police chief, our designated protector, was failing. The illness devouring him from within, the one he tried to hide behind a mask of stoicism, was winning the battle against his will.

The individual in the blue anorak took advantage of the distraction. His fingers sought his opponent's neck, squeezing the windpipe with lunatic force. His eyes bulged from their sockets, bloodshot, seeing enemies that only existed in his oxygen-deprived brain.

He was going to kill him. Right there, over a piece of cloth.

I straightened up, searching my pockets for the scalpel I had stolen, though I knew I wouldn't make it in time. The distance was an unbridgeable chasm.

Then, a white shadow slid into my peripheral vision.

He didn’t run. He didn’t scream. Doctor Arnald Soler moved with the fluidity of a specter passing through a wall. His wool lab coat rippled slightly around him, not like clothing, but like an extension of his own coldness.

He reached the tangle of limbs struggling on the floor. He didn’t try to separate them by force. He didn’t waste energy on useless struggles.

He knelt beside the aggressor, the one in the blue garment. His right hand descended, quick and precise like a viper’s strike. There was a metallic flash, brief, almost imperceptible in the morning’s dim light.

A sharp moan escaped the man’s lips.

Soler withdrew his hand.

One, two, three seconds.

The individual blinked, confused. The tension in his arms dissolved like a sugar cube in hot water. His eyelids fluttered, heavy, and he slumped to one side, rolling away from his victim’s body with the inert grace of a sack of sand.

The silence that followed was absolute, heavier than the storm raging outside.

The bearded man scrambled backward, gasping, touching his reddened throat. He looked at Soler not with gratitude, but with the pure terror of one who has just watched a larger predator devour a smaller one.

Lucas got to his feet with difficulty, leaning on a table. His gaze traveled from the unconscious man to the doctor’s right hand.

Soler straightened up slowly. He adjusted his glasses with a mechanical gesture, devoid of any emotion. In his hand, he held an empty syringe. The plunger was pressed all the way down. With a casual, almost bored movement, he put it into the deep pocket of his lab coat.

“He was wasting oxygen,” Soler said. His voice was flat, without edges, a straight line on a heart monitor. “And disturbing the others.”

I felt a new cold, distinct from the mountain's, spread in the pit of my stomach.

He hadn't hesitated. He hadn't assessed the situation. And the most terrifying thing: he had the syringe ready. Loaded. Ready in his pocket before the fight even began. As if he had been waiting for an excuse, any excuse, to use it.

My gaze met Lucas's. In his dark, tired eyes, I saw my own conclusion reflected, a certainty that chilled the blood more than any blizzard.

The doctor wasn't taking care of us. He was managing us. Like cattle. Or worse, like specimens in a Petri dish that must be kept still to be studied.

No one said anything. No one claimed the blanket. The sedated man snored softly on the floor, and the rest of us drew away from Arnald Soler, creating a circle of emptiness around him. He simply sat back in his armchair, opened a book, and continued reading, as if he had just squashed an annoying insect.

The library was no longer a refuge. It was a waiting room. And the doctor decided who moved on to the next phase.

## Chapter 19: El Paciente Cero

**Aigüestortes, December 23, 2018**
**East Wing of the Grand Hotel**

The corridor connecting the main building to the closed-off wing was no mere hallway; it was a gullet of rotten wood that threatened to swallow them whole.

Elena Vives advanced, hugging the wall where the main beams offered greater support. Each step was a negotiation with gravity. The floorboards groaned with the whine of a dying animal beneath her hiking boots, releasing clouds of dust and spores that danced in the beam of her flashlight. Behind her, Lucas Riera's breathing was heavy, rhythmic, marked by the effort of dragging a right leg which the storm's humidity had turned into a block of concrete and pain.

“Step where I step,” she whispered, though the advice was unnecessary.

Lucas didn't respond. He merely swept the darkness with the barrel of his service weapon, an extension of steel that trembled imperceptibly in his calloused hand. The cold here was different from that of the library; it wasn't the crisp chill of snow, but stagnant, dense air, laden with the cloying scent of dampness and oblivion.

The east wing had been condemned decades ago, long before the hotel tried to reinvent itself as a luxury retreat. The doors on both sides of the corridor hung from their hinges or were boarded up with planks that time had warped. The wallpaper peeled in long, grayish strips, revealing the cracked plaster like the skin of a leper.

Elena stopped before a fork where the ceiling had partially given way, allowing snow to seep in and form a white mound on the threadbare carpet.

“According to the evacuation plans I saw in the lobby, the main suites were at the far end,” she said, her voice barely a wisp of vapor. “If someone wanted to hide something valuable, or shameful, they would do it far from the eyes of guests and staff.”

“Or it’s just a ruined area, Elena.” Lucas wiped the sweat from his forehead with the back of his left hand. “If we take one wrong step here, we’ll fall two floors down to the boiler room.”

“It’s not total ruin. Look.”

Elena pointed at the floor. Amidst the layer of dust and debris, there was a clean path. Someone had walked there recently. The footprints weren't clear; they had been deliberately erased, but the pattern of “cleanliness” in the grime was undeniable. A trace of order in the chaos.

They advanced. Tension coiled at the nape of Elena's neck, a physical pressure she knew well. Her profiler's mind, trained to dissect crime scenes, began cataloging the anomalies. There were no rats. The silence was absolute, a vacuum bell that isolated them from the howling wind outside.

They reached the end of the corridor. There, where logic dictated there should be a wall or a broken window, stood a solid oak door. Unlike the others, this one didn't have peeling paint. The brass knob gleamed, polished with obsessive care.

Lucas stepped forward, ignoring the protest of his knee, and placed his hand on the knob. It was locked, but the wood around the frame showed signs of having been forced and repaired multiple times, like a wound that opens and is stitched up again and again.

“Cover me,” the officer ordered.

With a dry thud of his shoulder, Lucas forced the mechanism. The door yielded with a hydraulic sigh, revealing a darkness far deeper than that of the corridor.

Elena entered first, raising her flashlight. The beam of light cut through the gloom and what it revealed stole her breath.

It wasn't a hotel room. It was a sanctuary.

The windows were hermetically sealed with metal sheets, preventing a single ray of natural light or snowflake from entering. The air inside was glacial, much colder than outside, artificially maintained by a ventilation system that hummed at an almost inaudible frequency. But what struck Elena wasn't the cold, but the smell.

Mint and antiseptic.

The scent was so strong it pricked at her throat. It was the same smell that, according to the files, permeated the killer's letters. The smell of clinical sterility.

“My God!” Lucas murmured, lowering his weapon.

In the center of the room, a 1970s hospital bed dominated the space. The sheets were stretched with military precision, not a single wrinkle. Beside it, a surgical metal table held a collection of amber glass bottles, antique glass syringes, and a black leather notebook.

The walls weren't adorned with paintings, but with anatomical diagrams and hand-drawn industrial refrigeration schematics.

Elena approached the table, feeling her pulse throb in her fingertips. She placed her flashlight on a flat surface to free her hands and picked up the notebook. Her green eyes scanned the pages. The handwriting was spiky, nervous.

““Day 450. Cellular degradation has stopped. Beauty remains.”” she read aloud. Her voice sounded strange in that acoustic chamber. ““Ice does not destroy; ice suspends. It is the only way to love something forever: by preventing it from changing.””

Lucas walked the perimeter of the room. He stopped before a low bookshelf.

“Elena, you have to see this.”

She closed the notebook and joined him. On the dark wooden ledge, there was a series of silver-framed photographs. They were old, black and white or sepia, but perfectly preserved.

The first showed a man in that very bed. He was emaciated, skin clinging to his skull, eyes sunken in dark sockets. A degenerative disease consumed him.

The second photo was what chilled the blood.

It showed the same man, but this time he wasn't alone. A boy, about ten years old, sat at the foot of the bed. The boy didn't look at his father with sadness, nor with fear. He looked at him with an analytical, almost scientific intensity. In the child's hands rested a block of ice, and his clear, inexpressive eyes seemed to study how the solid water melted between his fingers.

Elena picked up the photo. Turning it over, she found an inscription in faded blue ink: ““For my son, the only one who understands that death is merely a technical failure. 1982.””

“Patient Zero,” Elena whispered, feeling the puzzle pieces click into place in her mind. “All this... the hotel, the isolation, the obsession with cold. He’s not a random serial killer.”

She turned the photo so Lucas could see it clearly in the flashlight's beam.

“This man died here,” she continued, pointing to the empty bed. “Or at least, his body stopped functioning. But his son didn’t accept the end. He turned this room into a laboratory to try and preserve him.”

Lucas leaned closer to the image, his tired eyes narrowing.

“The Sculptor…” the officer said, comprehending the magnitude of the horror. “He doesn’t kill for pleasure. He’s practicing.”

“He’s perfecting the technique,” Elena corrected, looking around with new terror. “The diagrams on the wall weren’t theoretical; they were instructions. Each victim is a rehearsal. An attempt to achieve what he couldn’t with his father: perfect preservation. Immortality through ice.”

A dry crack, like wood splitting, echoed in the corridor outside.

Lucas spun around, pointing towards the open door. Elena instinctively extinguished her flashlight, plunging the room into a grayish gloom.

“Someone knows we’re here,” Lucas whispered.

Elena pressed the photograph against her chest. The Sculptor’s legal identity remained a mystery, a name in a census, but now they knew his soul. They knew where his monster came from. He was an orphaned child who refused to bury his father, and who had decided to freeze the entire world so he would never have to say goodbye again.

The vengeance wasn’t against people; it was against time itself. And they had just desecrated his church.

## Chapter 20: El Chivo Expiatorio

{
  "translated_text": "# Chapter 20: The Scapegoat\n\nAigüestortes Sanatorium, December 23, 2018\n\nThe hallway back from the sealed-off wing was not a path, but a stone throat devouring the light of our flashlights. The cold there wasn't a temperature; it was a physical presence, an entity with teeth gnawing at the fabric of my mountain coat, seeking the warmth of blood.\n\nLucas limped beside me. The sound of his right boot dragging on the broken tiled floor set a funereal rhythm, a metronome of our despair. In my pocket, the photograph stolen from Patient Zero's office weighed more than a granite slab. We had a face from the past, a child, but we needed a culprit in the present.\n\n\"Are you sure you want to do it this way?\" Lucas whispered. His voice bounced off the peeling walls, distorting.\n\n\"We have no choice,\" I replied, and my own breath condensed into a white cloud before my eyes. \"The killer is among us. If we don't act now, someone else will die tonight.\"\n\nWe reached the double doors of the common room. The wood creaked under Lucas's palm as he pushed. The heat from inside hit our faces, a slap of stale air, heavy with the smell of chimney smoke, rancid sweat, and concentrated fear.\n\nThe scene we found was a static tableau of defeat. The guests were scattered like shipwreck survivors on a raft too small. Doctor Arnald Soler cleaned his glasses with a cloth handkerchief, his myopic eyes squinting at the dying fire. And there, in a corner, away from the main light, he stood.\n\nJavier Blasco.\n\nThe quiet man. The one who barely spoke. The one who always observed with a neutrality that now, with the information burning in my mind, struck me as calculating.\n\nLucas advanced to the center of the room. His shadow stretched across the floor, gigantic and deformed.\n\n\"Nobody move,\" he commanded. He didn't shout, but the authority in his tone, forged in years of patrolling hostile streets, cut through the murmuring outside wind like a knife.\n\nHeads turned in unison. Soler slowly put on his glasses.\n\n\"Inspector Riera,\" the doctor said, with that unctuous voice that always made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. \"We were starting to worry. Did you find a way out?\"\n\n\"We found something better,\" I interjected, stepping forward. I felt their gazes pierce me, dozens of invisible needles. \"We found the motive.\"\n\nI crossed the room directly toward Blasco. He looked up from a tattered book on his lap. There was no surprise on his face, only an unsettling placidity, like the surface of a frozen lake hiding dark depths.\n\n\"Mr. Blasco,\" Lucas said, positioning himself to his right, his hand near the holster of his service weapon. \"Stand up. Slowly.\"\n\n\"Is something wrong?\" Blasco asked. His tone was flat, lacking the nervous vibration any innocent person would have in that situation.\n\n\"Your suitcase,\" I demanded, pointing to the brown leather luggage at his feet. \"Open it. Now.\"\n\nA murmur ran through the room. The rest of the survivors stood up, forming an irregular circle, drawn by the magnetism of the conflict. Human curiosity is a parasite that feeds on the misfortune of others.\n\n\"This is absurd,\" Blasco protested, but his hands obeyed.\n\nThe metal clasps snapped open. The sound was dry, definitive, like the trigger of an unloaded gun. He lifted the lid.\n\nClothes folded with military precision. A gray toiletry bag. Nothing at first glance.\n\n\"Step aside,\" Lucas gently pushed him with his shoulder and knelt.\n\nMy profiler's eyes scanned Blasco. I looked for signs of escape, tension in his jaw, pupil dilation. Nothing. Either he was innocent, or he was a psychopath with absolute emotional control. Doubt, that corrosive acid, began to drip into my stomach.\n\nLucas rummaged through the shirts. His large, calloused hands probed the lining. Suddenly, he stopped.\n\n\"Elena,\" he called, without taking his eyes off the inside of the luggage.\n\nI approached. Lucas extracted an object wrapped in a hotel towel. He unwrapped it on the floor with ceremonial care.\n\nThe silence in the room turned solid.\n\nOn the white terry cloth lay a set of surgical scalpels, shiny, immaculate. And next to them, a small, unlabeled pharmaceutical glass bottle, filled with a clear liquid. But what stole the air from my lungs wasn't that.\n\nIt was the photographs.\n\nThree Polaroids scattered like cards from a macabre deck. They weren't landscape photos. They were close-ups. Open, glassy eyes covered in frost. Blue lips stitched with fishing line. The Sculptor's \"work,\" documented with the pride of an artist cataloging his collection.\n\nThe menthol scent enveloped me. It came from the clothes in the suitcase. That antiseptic, clean scent that had permeated Patient Zero's room.\n\n\"My God!\" someone exclaimed behind me. I think it was one of the young tourists.\n\nBlasco took a step back, hitting the wall. For the first time, the mask of calm cracked. His eyes widened disproportionately, two wells of genuine panic.\n\n\"That's not mine,\" he stammered. His voice rose an octave. \"I swear it's not mine! Someone put it there. I haven't touched that suitcase all day!\"\n\n\"He has photos of the corpses, for God's sake!\" roared Dr. Soler, stepping forward with a fury that struck me as strangely theatrical. \"You killed them! You froze them as if they were pieces of meat!\"\n\n\"No!\" Blasco waved his hands. \"I'm an accountant! I'm from Madrid! I know nothing about this!\"\n\nLucas didn't wait any longer. Police instinct took over any reasonable doubt. He lunged at Blasco, twisting him against the wall with a dull thud.\n\n\"Hands behind your back!\" Lucas yelled.\n\n\"They're setting me up!\" the accused shrieked, struggling weakly. He didn't have the physical strength to move bodies, I thought fleetingly. How could he have dragged the victims? But the adrenaline of the moment swept away my logical analysis like an avalanche.\n\n\"Hold still!\" Lucas twisted his arm. Blasco whimpered in pain.\n\n\"Arnald, the rope,\" I requested, pointing to the supplies we had stacked near the fireplace.\n\nDoctor Soler handed me a roll of nylon cord with trembling hands. I approached Lucas, and together we tied Blasco's wrists. The nylon dug into his skin, white and soft, nothing like the hands of a craftsman or a killer who works with ice.\n\nWe seated him in a sturdy wooden chair, away from the exit, and secured his ankles to the legs. Blasco was crying now. Thick, silent tears rolled down his cheeks and died on his shirt.\n\n\"Why?\" Lucas asked, standing in front of him, his chest heaving. \"Why do something like this?\"\n\n\"It wasn't me...\" Blasco sobbed, his head bowed. \"You have to believe me.\"\n\nI stepped away from the circle. The room seemed to exhale a collective sigh. The shoulders of those present dropped. The threat had a name and a face. It was tied. It was no longer a ghost lurking in the blizzard, but a pathetic man strapped to a chair.\n\nI walked to the window. My reflection in the glass showed a woman with deep dark circles and matted hair. Behind my reflection, the storm still roared, indifferent to our small victory.\n\nI looked at the Polaroids that had been left on the floor. Something didn't fit. The Sculptor sought perfection, eternity. These photos were out of focus, poorly framed. They were vulgar.

  "translated_text": "# Chapter 20: The Scapegoat\n\nAigüestortes Sanatorium, December 23, 2018\n\nThe hallway back from the sealed-off wing was not a path, but a stone throat devouring the light of our flashlights. The cold there wasn't a temperature; it was a physical presence, an entity with teeth gnawing at the fabric of my mountain coat, seeking the warmth of blood.\n\nLucas limped beside me. The sound of his right boot dragging on the broken tiled floor set a funereal rhythm, a metronome of our despair. In my pocket, the photograph stolen from Patient Zero's office weighed more than a granite slab. We had a face from the past, a child, but we needed a culprit in the present.\n\n\"Are you sure you want to do it this way?\" Lucas whispered. His voice bounced off the peeling walls, distorting.\n\n\"We have no choice,\" I replied, and my own breath condensed into a white cloud before my eyes. \"The killer is among us. If we don't act now, someone else will die tonight.\"\n\nWe reached the double doors of the common room. The wood creaked under Lucas's palm as he pushed. The heat from inside hit our faces, a slap of stale air, heavy with the smell of chimney smoke, rancid sweat, and concentrated fear.\n\nThe scene we found was a static tableau of defeat. The guests were scattered like shipwreck survivors on a raft too small. Doctor Arnald Soler cleaned his glasses with a cloth handkerchief, his myopic eyes squinting at the dying fire. And there, in a corner, away from the main light, he stood.\n\nJavier Blasco.\n\nThe quiet man. The one who barely spoke. The one who always observed with a neutrality that now, with the information burning in my mind, struck me as calculating.\n\nLucas advanced to the center of the room. His shadow stretched across the floor, gigantic and deformed.\n\n\"Nobody move,\" he commanded. He didn't shout, but the authority in his tone, forged in years of patrolling hostile streets, cut through the murmuring outside wind like a knife.\n\nHeads turned in unison. Soler slowly put on his glasses.\n\n\"Inspector Riera,\" the doctor said, with that unctuous voice that always made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. \"We were starting to worry. Did you find a way out?\"\n\n\"We found something better,\" I interjected, stepping forward. I felt their gazes pierce me, dozens of invisible needles. \"We found the motive.\"\n\nI crossed the room directly toward Blasco. He looked up from a tattered book on his lap. There was no surprise on his face, only an unsettling placidity, like the surface of a frozen lake hiding dark depths.\n\n\"Mr. Blasco,\" Lucas said, positioning himself to his right, his hand near the holster of his service weapon. \"Stand up. Slowly.\"\n\n\"Is something wrong?\" Blasco asked. His tone was flat, lacking the nervous vibration any innocent person would have in that situation.\n\n\"Your suitcase,\" I demanded, pointing to the brown leather luggage at his feet. \"Open it. Now.\"\n\nA murmur ran through the room. The rest of the survivors stood up, forming an irregular circle, drawn by the magnetism of the conflict. Human curiosity is a parasite that feeds on the misfortune of others.\n\n\"This is absurd,\" Blasco protested, but his hands obeyed.\n\nThe metal clasps snapped open. The sound was dry, definitive, like the trigger of an unloaded gun. He lifted the lid.\n\nClothes folded with military precision. A gray toiletry bag. Nothing at first glance.\n\n\"Step aside,\" Lucas gently pushed him with his shoulder and knelt.\n\nMy profiler's eyes scanned Blasco. I looked for signs of escape, tension in his jaw, pupil dilation. Nothing. Either he was innocent, or he was a psychopath with absolute emotional control. Doubt, that corrosive acid, began to drip into my stomach.\n\nLucas rummaged through the shirts. His large, calloused hands probed the lining. Suddenly, he stopped.\n\n\"Elena,\" he called, without taking his eyes off the inside of the luggage.\n\nI approached. Lucas extracted an object wrapped in a hotel towel. He unwrapped it on the floor with ceremonial care.\n\nThe silence in the room turned solid.\n\nOn the white terry cloth lay a set of surgical scalpels, shiny, immaculate. And next to them, a small, unlabeled pharmaceutical glass bottle, filled with a clear liquid. But what stole the air from my lungs wasn't that.\n\nIt was the photographs.\n\nThree Polaroids scattered like cards from a macabre deck. They weren't landscape photos. They were close-ups. Open, glassy eyes covered in frost. Blue lips stitched with fishing line. The Sculptor's \"work,\" documented with the pride of an artist cataloging his collection.\n\nThe menthol scent enveloped me. It came from the clothes in the suitcase. That antiseptic, clean scent that had permeated Patient Zero's room.\n\n\"My God!\" someone exclaimed behind me. I think it was one of the young tourists.\n\nBlasco took a step back, hitting the wall. For the first time, the mask of calm cracked. His eyes widened disproportionately, two wells of genuine panic.\n\n\"That's not mine,\" he stammered. His voice rose an octave. \"I swear it's not mine! Someone put it there. I haven't touched that suitcase all day!\"\n\n\"He has photos of the corpses, for God's sake!\" roared Dr. Soler, stepping forward with a fury that struck me as strangely theatrical. \"You killed them! You froze them as if they were pieces of meat!\"\n\n\"No!\" Blasco waved his hands. \"I'm an accountant! I'm from Madrid! I know nothing about this!\"\n\nLucas didn't wait any longer. Police instinct took over any reasonable doubt. He lunged at Blasco, twisting him against the wall with a dull thud.\n\n\"Hands behind your back!\" Lucas yelled.\n\n\"They're setting me up!\" the accused shrieked, struggling weakly. He didn't have the physical strength to move bodies, I thought fleetingly. How could he have dragged the victims? But the adrenaline of the moment swept away my logical analysis like an avalanche.\n\n\"Hold still!\" Lucas twisted his arm. Blasco whimpered in pain.\n\n\"Arnald, the rope,\" I requested, pointing to the supplies we had stacked near the fireplace.\n\nDoctor Soler handed me a roll of nylon cord with trembling hands. I approached Lucas, and together we tied Blasco's wrists. The nylon dug into his skin, white and soft, nothing like the hands of a craftsman or a killer who works with ice.\n\nWe seated him in a sturdy wooden chair, away from the exit, and secured his ankles to the legs. Blasco was crying now. Thick, silent tears rolled down his cheeks and died on his shirt.\n\n\"Why?\" Lucas asked, standing in front of him, his chest heaving. \"Why do something like this?\"\n\n\"It wasn't me...\" Blasco sobbed, his head bowed. \"You have to believe me.\"\n\nI stepped away from the circle. The room seemed to exhale a collective sigh. The shoulders of those present dropped. The threat had a name and a face. It was tied. It was no longer a ghost lurking in the blizzard, but a pathetic man strapped to a chair.\n\nI walked to the window. My reflection in the glass showed a woman with deep dark circles and matted hair. Behind my reflection, the storm still roared, indifferent to our small victory.\n\nI looked at the Polaroids that had been left on the floor. Something didn't fit. The Sculptor sought perfection, eternity. These photos were out of focus, poorly framed. They were vulgar. And the suitcase... it wasn't locked, accessible to anyone in the common room while Blasco went to the bathroom or slept.\n\n\"We got him, Elena,\" Lucas said, standing beside me. He put an arm around my shoulders. I felt the warmth of his body, and for a second, I wanted to fall into him, forget logic, forget the scar on my palm, and simply accept that the horror was over.\n\n\"Yes,\" I lied. My voice sounded hollow. \"We got him.\"\n\nDoctor Soler had approached the suitcase and was looking at the scalpels with morbid fascination.\n\n\"Precise work,\" he murmured to himself, though I heard him perfectly. \"Very precise.\"\n\nOutside, the wind howled with renewed force, rattling the windows. The White Beast pounded the sanatorium walls, furious that we had snatched away its servant. Or perhaps, it was laughing.\n\nI looked at Blasco, huddled in his chair, defeated. And then I looked at the rest of the room, at the shadows dancing in the corners where the firelight didn't reach. The feeling of relief flooding the room seemed like a dangerous narcotic.

## Chapter 21: Inocencia Congelada

Aigüestortes Refuge, Catalan Pyrenees
December 24, 2018. 3:15 a.m.

The silence was not an absence of sound, but a physical presence that pressed against the eardrums until they ached. Outside, the White Beast had decided to take a breath, a deceptive truce in which the wind ceased its howling to allow the cold to do its work in solitude: to petrify the world.

Elena Vives observed the phosphorescent hands of her analog watch. The second hand advanced with that military cadence her father had taught her to respect and fear in equal measure. A quarter past three. The wolf's hour. The hour when human biology is most vulnerable and the spirit's defenses surrender to fatigue.

She couldn't sleep. The image of Javier Blasco's suitcase, filled with scalpels and macabre Polaroids, continued to dance behind her eyelids every time she tried to close them. It was too perfect. Too symmetrical. In nature, nothing fits with such precision unless it has been forced by the hand of man. Glaciology had taught her that ice is chaotic in its microscopic structure; it only appears smooth from a distance. And that case, seen up close, had cracks.

She sat up on the cot in the common room. The air was stale, heavy with the deep breathing of the survivors who slept the sleep of the just, or of the condemned, believing the monster was caged. Lucas Riera dozed in a chair by the door, his chin pressed to his chest and his right hand resting on the holster of his service weapon. Even in sleep, the police chief maintained the posture of an exhausted sheepdog.

Elena slipped out from under the blankets. The wooden floorboards creaked under her boots, a dry groan that made Lucas instantly open an eye.

“Where are you going?” he whispered. His voice was gravel and fatigue.

“I need to see him,” Elena adjusted the collar of her fleece jacket. The cold from the hallway was seeping in under the door. “There’s something in his statement… the way he was screaming that it was a trap. Narcissistic psychopaths don’t usually plead, Lucas. They manipulate, seduce, or remain silently superior. Blasco was terrified.”

Lucas rubbed his face with his calloused hands, stretching the skin to chase away sleep.

“The evidence is solid, Elena. He had the tools. He had the photos.”

“The tools were clean. Too clean for someone who’s supposedly been operating in this valley for years.” Elena already had the flashlight in her hand and the key to room 204 in her pocket. “I’m just going to check that he’s still there. I need to see his eyes one more time without the clamor of the crowd accusing him.”

Lucas stood up, ignoring the pang in his right leg that always warned him of pressure changes.

“You’re not going alone.”

They stepped into the hallway. The temperature there dropped drastically, turning their breath into small, ephemeral clouds that vanished before touching the ceiling. The corridor was plunged into liquid darkness, barely broken by the white beam of Elena's flashlight. The shadows of the beams stretched and contracted like the ribs of an immense animal breathing slowly.

They reached door 204. The wood was robust, old pine.

“Do you have the key?” Lucas asked, his hand already on the doorknob, verifying it was still locked from the inside.

Elena nodded and pulled out the cold metal. She inserted it into the lock. The *click* of the mechanism turning sounded like a gunshot in the refuge's stillness.

“Stay back,” Lucas ordered, regaining his role, gently moving her aside with his shoulder to enter first.

He pushed the wooden door open.

The smell hit them before the sight. It wasn't the stench of putrefaction; that would take hours. It was a ferrous, dense, and warm aroma, mixed with the involuntary emptying of the sphincters that accompanies the end of life. It smelled like a freshly hosed-down slaughterhouse.

Lucas raised his tactical flashlight and swept the room.

Elena stifled a scream, bringing the back of her hand to her mouth to block the bile that rose in her throat like boiling acid.

Javier Blasco was still in the chair where they had left him. But his posture had changed. His head hung back at an unnatural, almost obscene angle, defying his cervical vertebrae.

“My God!” Lucas murmured, taking two steps forward, his weapon drawn and pointing at the empty corners of the room.

Elena, driven by a morbid force that overcame her fear, approached. The light from her flashlight illuminated the prisoner's neck.

It hadn't been a struggle. It had been an execution.

A deep, clean, surgical cut ran across his throat from left to right. It had severed the carotid artery and jugular vein with such precision that the edges of the wound looked as if drawn with a ruler. Blood had spurted out forcefully, soaking Blasco's chest, the chair, and creating a black, viscous puddle that crept towards Elena's feet. It was no longer flowing; his heart had stopped pumping a while ago. The blood was beginning to take on that gelatinous texture, similar to blackcurrant jam, indicating that death had occurred at least an hour ago.

“The door was locked…” Elena whispered. Her analytical mind tried to process the horror by converting it into data, into physics, into anything but reality. “Lucas, the door was locked.”

The officer approached the body, avoiding stepping into the crimson lake. He holstered his weapon and put on the latex gloves he always kept in his back pocket, a habit from his days in the city.

“The restraints,” he said, his voice trembling. “Look at his wrists.”

Elena directed the beam of light towards Blasco's hands, tied to the back of the chair. The knots were intact. The climbing rope dug into the pale flesh, taut and cruel. There wasn't a single sign that he had tried to free himself. Whoever had entered had done so with such stealth or authority that Blasco hadn't even had time to struggle.

Or he knew his killer.

“He couldn't have done it himself,” Lucas stated, verifying the incipient rigidity of the fingers. “No one cuts their own throat like this and then ties their hands behind their back. It’s physically impossible.”

Elena felt the floor tilt. The false security of the past six hours crumbled like a powder snow avalanche. They had believed they had the culprit. They had slept, they had let down their guard, they had felt that narcotic relief of justice served.

And while they rested, the true Sculptor had entered this room.

“He’s here,” Elena said. The words left her mouth like cold stones. “Lucas, he hasn’t left. Blasco isn’t the killer. Blasco was the bait.”

Lucas turned towards her. His face, lit from below by the flashlight, looked like a tragic theater mask, accentuating the dark circles under his eyes and the terror in his brown eyes.

“We have to wake the others,” he said. “Right now.”

But before they could take a step towards the exit, a noise in the hallway froze them. It wasn't the wind. It was the creak of a floorboard. Someone had been listening. Someone breathing with the calm of one who has just completed a masterpiece.

Elena looked at the bled-out body, Blasco’s “inocence” written in red on his shirt. The truth hadn't freed them; it had trapped them in a tomb of ice with an invisible predator.

Panic, that creature that had been clawing at the walls of her mind since they arrived, finally broke down the door and flooded everything.

“Close the door,” Elena ordered, her voice broken by the certainty of disaster. “Close it, Lucas. We don’t know who’s on the other side.”

  "translated_text": "# CHAPTER 22: Lucas's Betrayal\n\n**Aigüestortes Refuge, Catalan Pyrenees**\n**December 24, 2018, 6:15 a.m.**\n\nThe silence that follows the discovery of a corpse is not the absence of sound, but a high-pitched, almost electric frequency that settles at the base of the skull. Elena Vives walked down the second-floor hallway, moving away from room 204, feeling that vibration crawl up her spine. She left behind the coppery scent of spilled blood, that metallic, sickly-sweet fragrance that clung to the palate like a layer of rancid grease, but the image of Javier Blasco, bound and his throat cut with a butcher's precision, remained seared into her retinas with the fidelity of a forensic photograph.\n\nBeside her, Lucas Riera’s footsteps were uneven. The police chief dragged his right leg slightly, a rhythmic sound—*clack, drag, clack*—that echoed against the polished wooden floor. At another time, that defect in his gait would have evoked compassion; now, it only stirred a clinical suspicion within her, cold and sharp.\n\nThey reached a bend in the hallway, a sort of blind alcove meant for storing linen, far from the curious ears of guests who were sleeping, or pretending to, downstairs. The only light came from a small window through which the bluish, sickly light of dawn filtered, tinged by the storm that continued to rage outside, oblivious to human tragedy, burying the valley under tons of white indifference.\n\nElena stopped dead in her tracks and spun on her heels. The movement was so abrupt that Lucas had to stop short, bracing a large, calloused hand against the wall to keep from losing his balance.\n\n“Shut up,” she ordered before he could utter a word. Her voice was nothing more than a whisper, but it carried the authority of someone who had interrogated monsters and knew the architecture of lies.\n\nLucas blinked, confused. The dark circles under his brown eyes looked like soot craters on a face that had aged ten years in five hours.\n\n“Elena, we have to go downstairs. We have to secure the perimeter and notify—”\n\n“No one comes in and no one goes out, Lucas. We already know that.” Elena took a step towards him, invading his personal space. She needed to see his pupils, to look for the dilation of fear or the contraction of guilt.\n\n“What do you mean?” The officer ran a hand through his black hair, flecked with premature gray at the temples, in a gesture of exasperation.\n\n“Room 204’s door,” she said, enunciating each syllable with surgical slowness. “It was locked. We had to use your master key to get in. But when I checked Blasco’s pockets, there was nothing. Not on the table, not on the floor.”\n\nElena watched Lucas’s Adam’s apple bob as he swallowed. The tension in the small cubicle grew, displacing the air.\n\n“The killer took it,” Lucas ventured, though his voice lacked conviction.\n\n“Correct. The killer locked it from the outside. He turned the bolt, secured the door, and left with the trophy.” Elena fixed her moss-green eyes on his, searching for a crack. “But to lock it from the outside, you need a key. And in this refuge, there are only three sets: the guest’s, which has disappeared; the caretakers’, which hangs at the reception; and the master.”\n\nShe paused, letting the implication float between them like the vapor of their breaths in the frigid hallway air.\n\n“You have the master key, Lucas.”\n\nThe man recoiled instinctively, his back hitting a shelf full of clean towels. The scent of industrial lavender, so domestic and safe, felt obscene in that context.\n\n“What are you implying?” he asked, his tone oscillating between offense and panic.\n\n“I’m not implying. I’m analyzing variables.” Elena crossed her arms over her chest, protecting her vital organs, a habit acquired after years of coexisting with human predation. “Blasco died hours ago. The blood was coagulated, his liver temperature had dropped. It happened during the night. While we all slept. Or while we were supposed to be sleeping.”\n\n“I was in my room,” Lucas defended, but his hands began to tremble. It wasn’t a subtle tremor; it was a nervous shaking he tried to hide by thrusting his fists into the pockets of his worn corduroy trousers.\n\n“Show it to me,” Elena demanded, extending her left hand, the crescent-shaped scar gleaming pale under the spectral light from the window.\n\n“What?”\n\n“The master key. Take it out. Now.”\n\nLucas looked at her, and in that gaze, Elena saw the police chief crumble, the protector of the valley, the man who had maintained his composure when the snow isolated them. What remained before her was an eroded human being, full of cracks through which dignity seeped away.\n\n“I can’t,” he whispered.\n\nElena’s stomach clenched, an acidic nausea that had nothing to do with the corpse upstairs and everything to do with betrayal.\n\n“Why can’t you, Lucas?”\n\nHe took his right hand out of his pocket. It was empty. Then his left. Also empty. He patted his coat, his trousers, with a theatrical desperation that Elena found pathetic. But it wasn’t theater. It was the confirmation of a catastrophe.\n\n“It’s not there,” he confessed, his voice broken. “I had it last night. I swear on my life, Elena. I left it on the nightstand, next to my weapon.”\n\nElena felt the ground beneath her hiking boots lose its solidity. The only alliance she had allowed herself to trust, the sole pillar of authority in that white hell, had just turned to sand.\n\n“Are you telling me you lost the only item that guarantees access to every room in this refuge with a killer on the loose?”\n\n“I didn’t lose it,” he retorted, and suddenly shame gave way to defensive anger. “They took it from me. Someone entered my room while I was sleeping and took it.”\n\nElena let out a dry laugh, devoid of humor.\n\n“They entered your room? You, a trained officer, with the light sleep of someone who’s been patrolling for twenty years, and you heard nothing? Not the doorknob turning, not footsteps, not the breathing of a stranger a foot and a half from your bed?”\n\nLucas lowered his head. His breathing became heavy, noisy. He seemed to be fighting an internal battle, torn between maintaining a facade of steel that was already rusted or letting the truth, however corrosive, come to light.\n\n“I don’t have light sleep, Elena. Not lately.”\n\nHe reached into the inner pocket of his jacket and pulled out an orange plastic vial, the kind dispensed in pharmacies with a strict prescription. He held it in the palm of his hand, offering it as incriminating evidence. The sound of the pills rattling against the sides of the container sounded like a warning rattle.\n\nElena took the vial. She read the label. The chemical name was complex, but she knew the drug family. Dopaminergic agonists. Potent sedatives. Medication for severe neurological disorders.\n\nShe looked up, re-evaluating everything she thought she knew about the man before her. The limp. The chronic fatigue. The large hands he sometimes hid under the table.\n\n“What is this?” she asked, though her analytical mind was already connecting the dots, drawing a straight line between the symptom and the diagnosis.\n\n“I have early-onset Parkinson’s,” Lucas said. The word left his mouth like a stone swallowed years ago. “Early degeneration. The doctors say it’s progressing fast.”\n\nElena’s world tilted. The confession didn’t evoke pity in her. It evoked vertigo.\n\n“I took the nighttime dose,” he continued, speaking disjointedly, as if by shedding the ballast he could avoid shipwreck. “It knocks me out. It’s like my brain gets switched off. I don’t dream, I don’t move. If they’d fired a cannon in the hallway, I wouldn’t have woken up.”\n\nElena squeezed the vial until the plastic creaked. Rage, hot and liquid, began to pump through her veins, replacing fear.\n\n“You hid this from me.”\n\n“I didn’t want you to treat me like an invalid. I’m the authority here. If they knew I was sick...”\n\n“This isn’t about your pride, damn it!” Elena’s shout echoed off the narrow walls, startling both of them. “It’s about safety! We’re trapped with someone who slits people’s throats like livestock. I trusted you because I thought you were capable of watching, of reacting. And it turns out you drug yourself unconscious every night.”\n\nLucas tried to approach, to place a conciliatory hand on her shoulder, but Elena recoiled as if physical contact were contagious.\n\n“Elena, please. I’m still me. I can still shoot, I can still think...”\n\n“No,” she cut him off, relentless. “Last night, while you slept your chemical sleep, someone entered your room. Someone who knew you wouldn’t wake up. They took the key from your nightstand, walked to Javier’s room, tortured him, killed him, locked the door with your key, and probably either put it back or kept it. And you didn’t notice a thing.”\n\nThe raw truth of the account struck Lucas. He leaned against the wall, sliding down a few centimeters, defeated by the profiler’s crushing logic.\n\n“I’m a hindrance,” he murmured.\n\n“You’re a risk,” Elena corrected. The cruelty was necessary; survival didn’t understand euphemisms. “And the worst part isn’t the illness, Lucas. It’s the lie. You’ve allowed me to operate based on false data. I thought I had a partner.”\n\n“You do,” he insisted, looking up, his eyes moist with despair.\n\n“No. I have a sick man who has lost control of his own safety and, by extension, of mine.”\n\nElena tossed him the vial of pills. Lucas caught it in the air with a clumsy reflex, nearly dropping it.\n\n“Who else knows?” she asked, reverting to her professional, icy tone.\n\n“No one. Only my doctor in Vielha.”\n\n“The killer knows,” Elena declared. She turned towards the window, watching the snow pile up on the sill, layer upon layer, obscuring the world. “Whoever it is, they knew you’d be out of commission. They knew they could enter your room and take the key without risk. That means they’ve been watching you. You. Your trembling hands. Your pills.”\n\nA shiver that had nothing to do with the temperature ran down Lucas’s spine. The idea of having been studied, analyzed, and dismissed as a threat while he believed he was in control was humiliating.\n\n“What do we do now?” he asked, relinquishing command without complaint.\n\nElena looked at the scar on her palm. She recalled the previous case, the one that had forced her retirement. The mistake of trusting that variables were static. Nature was chaos, and human beings, a part of it. She had made the mistake of looking for order in Lucas, and chaos had devoured it.\n\n“You don’t do anything,” she said without looking at him. “You’re going downstairs, you’re going to sit in the common room, and you’re going to watch the others. If you can even keep your eyes open.”\n\n“Elena...”\n\n“I’m going to find that key. And I’m going to find out what else you’ve hidden from us.”\n\n“I haven’t hidden anything else from you.”\n\nElena turned to look at him one last time. The distance between them in that narrow hallway was barely two meters, but emotionally, an insurmountable chasm had opened, a deep and dark glacial crevice. The alliance had fractured. They were no longer “us.” It was “me” and “him.”\n\nElena walked past him, brushing his shoulder with deliberate indifference, and headed towards the stairs, leaving him alone in the hallway’s gloom, with his vial of pills in his hand and the weight of a corpse and a betrayal on his burdened shoulders. The sound of her receding footsteps was the only thing that broke the electric hum of the silence.\n\nLucas stood there, static, as the storm outside battered the windows, demanding entry. He looked at his hands. They trembled. And for the first time in years, he didn’t know if it was from the illness or from the pure and absolute terror of knowing himself vulnerable.",

The only light came from a small window through which the bluish, sickly light of dawn filtered, tinged by the storm that continued to rage outside, oblivious to human tragedy, burying the valley under tons of white indifference.\n\nElena stopped dead in her tracks and spun on her heels. The movement was so abrupt that Lucas had to stop short, bracing a large, calloused hand against the wall to keep from losing his balance.\n\n“Shut up,” she ordered before he could utter a word. Her voice was nothing more than a whisper, but it carried the authority of someone who had interrogated monsters and knew the architecture of lies.\n\nLucas blinked, confused. The dark circles under his brown eyes looked like soot craters on a face that had aged ten years in five hours.\n\n“Elena, we have to go downstairs. We have to secure the perimeter and notify—”\n\n“No one comes in and no one goes out, Lucas. We already know that.” Elena took a step towards him, invading his personal space. She needed to see his pupils, to look for the dilation of fear or the contraction of guilt.\n\n“What do you mean?” The officer ran a hand through his black hair, flecked with premature gray at the temples, in a gesture of exasperation.\n\n“Room 204’s door,” she said, enunciating each syllable with surgical slowness. “It was locked. We had to use your master key to get in. But when I checked Blasco’s pockets, there was nothing. Not on the table, not on the floor.”\n\nElena watched Lucas’s Adam’s apple bob as he swallowed. The tension in the small cubicle grew, displacing the air.\n\n“The killer took it,” Lucas ventured, though his voice lacked conviction.\n\n“Correct. The killer locked it from the outside. He turned the bolt, secured the door, and left with the trophy.” Elena fixed her moss-green eyes on his, searching for a crack. “But to lock it from the outside, you need a key. And in this refuge, there are only three sets: the guest’s, which has disappeared; the caretakers’, which hangs at the reception; and the master.”\n\nShe paused, letting the implication float between them like the vapor of their breaths in the frigid hallway air.\n\n“You have the master key, Lucas.”\n\nThe man recoiled instinctively, his back hitting a shelf full of clean towels. The scent of industrial lavender, so domestic and safe, felt obscene in that context.\n\n“What are you implying?” he asked, his tone oscillating between offense and panic.\n\n“I’m not implying. I’m analyzing variables.” Elena crossed her arms over her chest, protecting her vital organs, a habit acquired after years of coexisting with human predation. “Blasco died hours ago. The blood was coagulated, his liver temperature had dropped. It happened during the night. While we all slept. Or while we were supposed to be sleeping.”\n\n“I was in my room,” Lucas defended, but his hands began to tremble. It wasn’t a subtle tremor; it was a nervous shaking he tried to hide by thrusting his fists into the pockets of his worn corduroy trousers.\n\n“Show it to me,” Elena demanded, extending her left hand, the crescent-shaped scar gleaming pale under the spectral light from the window.\n\n“What?”\n\n“The master key. Take it out. Now.”\n\nLucas looked at her, and in that gaze, Elena saw the police chief crumble, the protector of the valley, the man who had maintained his composure when the snow isolated them. What remained before her was an eroded human being, full of cracks through which dignity seeped away.\n\n“I can’t,” he whispered.\n\nElena’s stomach clenched, an acidic nausea that had nothing to do with the corpse upstairs and everything to do with betrayal.\n\n“Why can’t you, Lucas?”\n\nHe took his right hand out of his pocket. It was empty. Then his left. Also empty. He patted his coat, his trousers, with a theatrical desperation that Elena found pathetic. But it wasn’t theater. It was the confirmation of a catastrophe.\n\n“It’s not there,” he confessed, his voice broken. “I had it last night. I swear on my life, Elena. I left it on the nightstand, next to my weapon.”\n\nElena felt the ground beneath her hiking boots lose its solidity. The only alliance she had allowed herself to trust, the sole pillar of authority in that white hell, had just turned to sand.\n\n“Are you telling me you lost the only item that guarantees access to every room in this refuge with a killer on the loose?”\n\n“I didn’t lose it,” he retorted, and suddenly shame gave way to defensive anger. “They took it from me. Someone entered my room while I was sleeping and took it.”\n\nElena let out a dry laugh, devoid of humor.\n\n“They entered your room? You, a trained officer, with the light sleep of someone who’s been patrolling for twenty years, and you heard nothing? Not the doorknob turning, not footsteps, not the breathing of a stranger a foot and a half from your bed?”\n\nLucas lowered his head. His breathing became heavy, noisy. He seemed to be fighting an internal battle, torn between maintaining a facade of steel that was already rusted or letting the truth, however corrosive, come to light.\n\n“I don’t have light sleep, Elena. Not lately.”\n\nHe reached into the inner pocket of his jacket and pulled out an orange plastic vial, the kind dispensed in pharmacies with a strict prescription. He held it in the palm of his hand, offering it as incriminating evidence. The sound of the pills rattling against the sides of the container sounded like a warning rattle.\n\nElena took the vial. She read the label. The chemical name was complex, but she knew the drug family. Dopaminergic agonists. Potent sedatives. Medication for severe neurological disorders.\n\nShe looked up, re-evaluating everything she thought she knew about the man before her. The limp. The chronic fatigue. The large hands he sometimes hid under the table.\n\n“What is this?” she asked, though her analytical mind was already connecting the dots, drawing a straight line between the symptom and the diagnosis.\n\n“I have early-onset Parkinson’s,” Lucas said. The word left his mouth like a stone swallowed years ago. “Early degeneration. The doctors say it’s progressing fast.”\n\nElena’s world tilted. The confession didn’t evoke pity in her. It evoked vertigo.\n\n“I took the nighttime dose,” he continued, speaking disjointedly, as if by shedding the ballast he could avoid shipwreck. “It knocks me out. It’s like my brain gets switched off. I don’t dream, I don’t move. If they’d fired a cannon in the hallway, I wouldn’t have woken up.”\n\nElena squeezed the vial until the plastic creaked. Rage, hot and liquid, began to pump through her veins, replacing fear.\n\n“You hid this from me.”\n\n“I didn’t want you to treat me like an invalid. I’m the authority here. If they knew I was sick...”\n\n“This isn’t about your pride, damn it!” Elena’s shout echoed off the narrow walls, startling both of them. “It’s about safety! We’re trapped with someone who slits people’s throats like livestock. I trusted you because I thought you were capable of watching, of reacting. And it turns out you drug yourself unconscious every night.”\n\nLucas tried to approach, to place a conciliatory hand on her shoulder, but Elena recoiled as if physical contact were contagious.\n\n“Elena, please. I’m still me. I can still shoot, I can still think...”\n\n“No,” she cut him off, relentless. “Last night, while you slept your chemical sleep, someone entered your room. Someone who knew you wouldn’t wake up. They took the key from your nightstand, walked to Javier’s room, tortured him, killed him, locked the door with your key, and probably either put it back or kept it. And you didn’t notice a thing.”\n\nThe raw truth of the account struck Lucas. He leaned against the wall, sliding down a few centimeters, defeated by the profiler’s crushing logic.\n\n“I’m a hindrance,” he murmured.\n\n“You’re a risk,” Elena corrected. The cruelty was necessary; survival didn’t understand euphemisms. “And the worst part isn’t the illness, Lucas. It’s the lie. You’ve allowed me to operate based on false data. I thought I had a partner.”\n\n“You do,” he insisted, looking up, his eyes moist with despair.\n\n“No. I have a sick man who has lost control of his own safety and, by extension, of mine.”\n\nElena tossed him the vial of pills. Lucas caught it in the air with a clumsy reflex, nearly dropping it.\n\n“Who else knows?” she asked, reverting to her professional, icy tone.\n\n“No one. Only my doctor in Vielha.”\n\n“The killer knows,” Elena declared. She turned towards the window, watching the snow pile up on the sill, layer upon layer, obscuring the world. “Whoever it is, they knew you’d be out of commission. They knew they could enter your room and take the key without risk. That means they’ve been watching you. You. Your trembling hands. Your pills.”\n\nA shiver that had nothing to do with the temperature ran down Lucas’s spine. The idea of having been studied, analyzed, and dismissed as a threat while he believed he was in control was humiliating.\n\n“What do we do now?” he asked, relinquishing command without complaint.\n\nElena looked at the scar on her palm. She recalled the previous case, the one that had forced her retirement. The mistake of trusting that variables were static. Nature was chaos, and human beings, a part of it. She had made the mistake of looking for order in Lucas, and chaos had devoured it.\n\n“You don’t do anything,” she said without looking at him. “You’re going downstairs, you’re going to sit in the common room, and you’re going to watch the others. If you can even keep your eyes open.”\n\n“Elena...”\n\n“I’m going to find that key. And I’m going to find out what else you’ve hidden from us.”\n\n“I haven’t hidden anything else from you.”\n\nElena turned to look at him one last time. The distance between them in that narrow hallway was barely two meters, but emotionally, an insurmountable chasm had opened, a deep and dark glacial crevice. The alliance had fractured. They were no longer “us.” It was “me” and “him.”\n\nElena walked past him, brushing his shoulder with deliberate indifference, and headed towards the stairs, leaving him alone in the hallway’s gloom, with his vial of pills in his hand and the weight of a corpse and a betrayal on his burdened shoulders. The sound of her receding footsteps was the only thing that broke the electric hum of the silence.\n\nLucas stood there, static, as the storm outside battered the windows, demanding entry. He looked at his hands. They trembled. And for the first time in years, he didn’t know if it was from the illness or from the pure and absolute terror of knowing himself vulnerable.",

## Chapter 23: Termodinámica del Miedo

**Aigüestortes, December 24, 2018**
**Boiler Room**
**12:15 p.m.**

The descent into hell didn't smell of sulfur, but of stale diesel and stagnant damp.

Elena Vives left the second floor behind, carrying the weight of Lucas's betrayal as if it were a backpack full of rocks. Each metal step descending into the hotel's sub-basement echoed hollowly, a solitary percussion marking her distance from the rest of the group. The air grew dense and oppressive, a gelatinous mass that made breathing difficult. The disappointment in the officer had formed a hard crust around her emotions, a necessary shield for what her analytical mind called "execution mode."

At the end of the service stairs, a red-painted steel fire door stood ajar, waiting for her. As she crossed the threshold, the temperature plummeted. It wasn't the clean, crisp cold of the mountains; it was an industrial, dirty chill that clung to her skin beneath the layers of thermal clothing.

"Mrs. Vives?" The voice echoed off the concrete walls.

Ramón, the maintenance supervisor, emerged from the shadows of an immense cylindrical structure. He was a fifty-year-old man with perpetually grease-stained hands and blue overalls two sizes too big for him. He held a monkey wrench with the same reverence a soldier holds his rifle.

"You told me to come down if I found anything strange," the man said, wiping cold sweat from his forehead with the back of his wrist. His voice trembled, not from the cold, but with that instinctive vibration animals feel before a storm.

Elena stepped forward, illuminating with her flashlight the labyrinth of pipes that crisscrossed the ceiling like the exposed veins of a metal giant.

"What have you seen, Ramón?"

The mechanic pointed to the main boiler's control panel. The machine, a cast-iron behemoth that should have been roaring to heat the building, remained in sepulchral silence, as dead as the corpse they had left upstairs in the snow.

"It's not a malfunction," Ramón whispered, approaching the panel cautiously. "I tried purging the system, thinking it was an ice blockage. But look at this."

Elena leaned closer. She followed the man's index finger, which pointed to a series of brass valves at the base of the unit.

"The safety valves didn't trip. Someone bypassed them. And here..." Ramón illuminated a section of the intake pipe. "This isn't wear and tear. There are tool marks. Someone injected liquid nitrogen into the water circuit before blocking the flow."

Elena felt a knot in her stomach. The implication was terrifying in its precision.

"Sabotage?"

"Worse," the mechanic corrected, turning to her with wide eyes. "It's a technical execution. Whoever did this knew exactly where to strike so that the system wouldn't just fail, but would be beyond repair. They turned the hotel into a sealed freezer. They didn't want us to feel cold; they wanted to freeze us."

The revelation hit Elena with the force of a physical certainty. It wasn't chaos; it was design. The killer wasn't improvising. He was sculpting the environment to suit his work.

"Can it be fixed?" she asked, though she already suspected the answer.

Ramón shook his head and turned towards the back of the boiler, where the darkness was thickest.

"I need to see if the damage reached the heat exchanger. If I'm lucky, maybe I can rig a manual bypass, but..."

The man moved deeper into the gap between the machine and the brick wall. Elena stood still, analyzing the geometry of the space. The place had too many blind spots, a profusion of shadows where the flashlight's beam died without return.

A sharp, dry metallic sound clacked in the gloom.

"Ramón?"

"I've got it!" he exclaimed from the darkness. "There's an auxiliary lever, it looks like they left it..."

The sentence cut short.

There was no scream. Only a wet, visceral sound, like a boot sinking into mud, immediately followed by the clang of a heavy tool hitting the floor.

"Ramón?" Elena repeated, taking a step forward. Her right hand instinctively reached for the scalpel in her pocket.

The silence that followed was absolute, but it lasted barely a second. Then, the mechanic's body was flung from behind the boiler. He didn't walk; he fell. He collapsed at Elena's feet with the inert heaviness of dead flesh.

Her flashlight's beam swept over the body. Ramón's eyes were open, fixed on nothingness, and a steel rod—likely part of the boiler's mechanism itself, sharpened like a stiletto—pierced his throat from side to side. Blood gushed out, black under the artificial light, soaking his blue overalls.

Elena recoiled, her heart pounding against her ribs like a trapped bird.

A figure was silhouetted in the darkness, right where Ramón had been.

She didn't see its face. She only saw a silhouette shrouded in dark clothing, camouflaged against the basement's blackness, and the fleeting gleam of eyes that reflected her flashlight's beam with the indifference of an arctic predator.

The smell reached her then. It wasn't diesel.

Mint. And something chemical. Antiseptic.

The killer hadn't fled. He had been waiting for her. Using the mechanic as bait to lure her into the bowels of the building.

The figure took a step towards her. The movement was fluid, without urgency, with the terrifying calm of someone who controls time and space.

Elena didn't think. Her body, trained by trauma and survival, took command.

She spun on her heels and ran.

"Elena!" a voice whispered behind her. It wasn't a cry of threat, but an invitation. A taunt.

She lunged towards the pipe-lined corridor they had come from, but a metallic crash stopped her. An enormous stopcock, thrown with inhuman force, smashed against the wall inches from her head, showering sparks and blocking her direct route to the door.

She changed direction. She plunged into the labyrinth of auxiliary machines, towards the generator area.

She extinguished her flashlight.

Darkness instantly swallowed her. It was like going suddenly blind, but it was her only advantage. If she couldn't see, neither could he.

She moved by touch, hands extended, grazing cold metal and rough walls. Her boots slipped on oil slicks. Every breath was a thunderous roar in her own ears.

*Crack.*

A step. Behind her. Slow. Deliberate.

Elena ducked, sliding under a low pipe. She felt a sharp pain in her right forearm as a rusty iron scraped her skin through her jacket, but she bit back a scream. The pain was information; it told her she was still alive.

She crawled forward, feeling the warm blood trickle down her wrist, mixing with the grime on the floor. The mint smell seemed to hang in the air, drawing closer, defying the physics of ventilation.

She reached a fork. To the left, the distant hum of generators. To the right, a narrow corridor that smelled of dust and oblivion.

She chose the right. She straightened up and ran, scraping her shoulders against the narrow walls.

Her fingers fumbled for the doorknob at the end of the corridor. It was locked.

Panic, that animal she had kept at bay, clawed at the door of her consciousness.

She heard the sound of something dragging across the floor a few meters away. Metal against concrete. The killer wasn't running. He was herding her.

Elena forced the handle, pushing with her injured shoulder. The wood groaned, resisting.

"There's no escape, Elena," the voice said, much closer this time. Right behind her.

With a grunt of effort, she charged the door one last time. The rotten frame gave way. Elena fell forward, rolling onto a cold tiled floor, and kicked the door shut just as a gloved hand tried to slip through the opening.

She scrambled to her feet, gasping, and looked for something, anything, to barricade the access. She shoved an old metal filing cabinet against the wooden leaf.

She leaned against it, trembling, her arm throbbing to the rhythm of her racing blood. On the other side of the door, there was only silence. No banging, no attempts to force it open.

Only a soft laugh, barely a breath of air, before the sound of footsteps receded, rhythmic and calm, back into the darkness of the boiler room.

## Chapter 24: Ratas en el Muro

**Aigüestortes. Day 5. Afternoon.**

The world had narrowed to a sixty-centimeter-wide galvanized steel duct.

Elena Vives crawled forward on her elbows, transformed into a blind animal creeping through the guts of a metal beast. The darkness was not merely the absence of light; it was a physical, heavy entity, a leaden blanket that clung to her skin and seeped into her nostrils with a rancid smell of dust accumulated over decades and industrial grease.

Every movement was a negotiation with pain. The crescent-shaped scar on her left palm throbbed against the cold rivets of the floor, sending electric shocks up to her shoulder. Her unprotected knees struck against the duct's seams with a dull, cruel rhythm. *Clack. Drag. Gasp. Clack.*

She didn't know how long she'd been in there. The concept of time had dissolved into the blackness, leaving only the primitive urgency of escape. Behind her lay confinement; ahead, an uncertain promise of freedom or suffocation.

The glaciologist tried to focus her mind, that tool she used to dissect criminal profiles with surgical precision, but the environment conspired against logic. The air was stale, hot, and thin. She felt her lungs having to work double to extract the necessary oxygen, a mechanical task that was beginning to fail. Claustrophobia, that old enemy she kept at bay with open spaces and icy mountains, clawed at the back door of her consciousness.

“It’s just a tunnel. It has an exit. Every ventilation system obeys a logical architectural design.”

She repeated the technical lie like a mantra. But her body, wiser and more terrified, knew she was buried alive.

She paused for an instant to wipe away the sweat stinging her eyes. The silence of the duct was broken by a distant sound. It wasn't the wind, nor the settling of the building. It was voices.

The sound traveled through the metal with treacherous acoustic clarity, bouncing off the tin walls and amplifying as if inside a macabre cello. Elena held her breath, ignoring the burning in her chest. She crawled two meters further, to where a rectangular grate cut through the darkness below with sickly yellow stripes of light.

The light drew bars on her soot-streaked face. She peered out cautiously, pressing her ear to the cold metal.

“...that’s not what we agreed on.”

The voice chilled her blood more than any mountain blizzard. It was unmistakable. Grave, paternal, tinged with that medical authority that had so often comforted her.

Doctor Arnald Soler.

Elena felt the sheet metal floor vanish beneath her stomach. Arnald? Here? Her mind struggled to find an innocent explanation, but the doctor’s tone exuded a clandestine urgency that didn’t fit with any routine round.

“The process has accelerated,” another voice replied. This one wasn't human, or at least it didn't sound like it. It was a metallic whisper, devoid of inflection, as if the words were cut with a scalpel before being spoken. She couldn't see the speaker, only the elongated shadow it cast on the white tiles of what appeared to be a storage room.

“There are no more vials!” Soler’s voice broke, losing composure. “If the storm doesn’t abate, the generators will fail. And if they fail, the temperature will rise. You know what that means. They’ll rot. All your 'art' will turn into decomposed flesh.”

“Beauty requires sacrifice, Doctor. You know that better than anyone.”

“Don’t talk to me about sacrifice!” Arnald hit something, perhaps a metal table. The clang resonated through the duct, rattling Elena’s teeth. “I’m doing it for her. Only for her. If it weren’t for Julia...”

Elena bit her lower lip until she tasted the coppery tang of blood. *Julia.* Arnald’s daughter’s name. The missing piece of the puzzle, the leverage. The image of the benevolent doctor, her mentor, the man who had offered her refuge when her police career crumbled, shattered into a thousand unrecognizable pieces.

He wasn’t an ally. He was a pawn. Or worse, an architect of horror.

“Julia is safe as long as you fulfill your function,” the faceless voice said. There was a nuance in that tone, a sadistic satisfaction that reeked of antiseptic and madness. “Keep the bodies cold, Doctor Soler. And keep the profiler away from the truth. She is... astute. It would be a shame to have to add her to the collection prematurely.”

“Elena knows nothing,” Soler lied, and his voice trembled. “Keep her out of this.”

“That depends on you. And on the storm.”

Footsteps were heard, the creak of a heavy door opening and closing, and then, silence reclaimed the room below. Only Soler’s ragged breathing remained, as he seemed to sob in solitude.

Elena wanted to move, wanted to keep crawling away from that poisonous truth, but her body rebelled.

The attack came without warning, brutal and absolute.

The duct walls seemed to suddenly contract, as if the metal throat decided to swallow her. The air became solid. Elena opened her mouth to take a breath, but nothing came in. Her throat closed, a noose tightened by invisible hands.

“I can’t get out. I’m going to die here. Like her.”

The memory of her last case, the victim she couldn’t save, who died suffocated in a crawlspace while she analyzed clues kilometers away, superimposed itself on reality. She was no longer in the ducts of the Aigüestortes hospital. She was in that wooden box underground. The darkness was the same. The smell of fear was the same.

Her heart, a runaway war drum, pounded against her ribs with such violence that she feared they would break. Cold sweat drenched her back, mixing with the grime. Her limbs went numb, a painful tingling that heralded the paralysis of panic.

She wanted to scream, but the sound died in her larynx. If she screamed, Soler would hear her. And if Soler heard her, the man with the icy voice would return.

She was trapped between death by suffocation and death at the hands of a monster.

Her vision filled with black spots that danced like carrion flies. She felt gravity invert, the duct spinning on itself. She clawed at the metal with her nails, breaking them, searching for an exit that logic told her existed but terror concealed.

“Breathe. Elena, breathe.”

She couldn’t. The weight of the entire mountain was on her chest.

Amidst the sensory chaos, a rhythmic sound, tiny but constant, broke through the roar of her own blood in her ears.

*Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock.*

Her left wrist was pressed against the floor, near her ear. Her father’s watch. That old analog mechanism that had survived time, death, and oblivion. The hands, coated with a luminescent material that barely glowed anymore in the gloom, kept moving forward. Indifferent to fear. Indifferent to Soler’s betrayal. Indifferent to death.

One second. Another. Yet another.

Time didn’t stop. Order existed in that mechanism of gears and springs. If the watch could keep working in the darkness, so could she.

Elena closed her eyes and focused on that sound. She visualized the gears turning, tooth by tooth, with mathematical precision. She let the rhythm of the watch replace the chaotic rhythm of her heart.

*Inhale.* The air entered, painful and thin, but it entered.
*Exhale.* The fear left, not all of it, but enough to make space for survival.

The glacier doesn’t panic when pressure increases; it compacts, becomes harder, bluer, stronger. She had to be ice.

She opened her eyes. The darkness was still there, but it was no longer a monster; it was merely an absence of photons. The walls were still narrow, but they were just physical limits, not a coffin.

“Move,” she whispered, her hoarse voice sounding strange in the tube.

She forced her cramped muscles to respond. One knee forward. An elbow. Again. The pain was information: she was alive.

She crawled away from the grate where Soler wept for his sin. She advanced five meters, 10, 15. The duct took a ninety-degree turn to the right. She felt a current of fresher air, a faint thread that smelled of bleach and clean laundry.

At the end of the section, another grate. This one wasn’t screwed in as firmly. The light entering was white, sterile.

Elena turned onto her back with difficulty, braced her boots against the grate, and pushed. The metal creaked, resisting. She gritted her teeth and unleashed all the frustration, all the anger over Arnald’s betrayal, in a single kick.

The grate gave way with a metallic crash that echoed like a gunshot.

Elena dropped down.

The impact against the tiled floor was hard. Pain exploded in her hip and shoulder, but it was the pain of freedom. She rolled onto herself, coughing, spitting out the gray dust that coated her tongue.

She lay there for a moment, looking at the white, immaculate ceiling. She was covered in soot, sweat, and dried blood. She looked like a specter risen from the underworld to stain the asepsis of that place.

She slowly got up, checking for broken bones. She was in the hospital laundry room. Large white sheets hung like ghosts on the shelves. The hum of an industrial dryer masked the sound of her fall.

She was free from the wall. But the prison was much larger than she imagined.

She looked at her trembling hands. Black with grime.

Arnald Soler, the man who had taught her to trust again, was collaborating with the killer to save his daughter Julia. The enemy wasn't just outside, in the storm, lurking in the snow. The enemy had keys, a white coat, and access to every room.

Elena got to her feet, swaying. She wiped her face with her sleeve, leaving a dirty streak on her cheek. Her green eyes, now framed in black, gleamed with a cold and terrible determination.

She was no longer the victim trapped in the duct. Now she was the witness. And ice, when it breaks, cuts.

## Chapter 25: Punto de Congelación

The corridor of the scientific station's north wing stretched like a concrete throat, swallowed by the darkness the storm imposed from outside. The auxiliary generator coughed somewhere in the basement, sending spasms of yellowish light that made shadows dance on the flaking walls. The cold wasn't just a temperature; it was a physical presence, an entity that bit at the skin through layers of thermal clothing.

Elena Vives moved along the wall, her breath held deep in her lungs. Her left hand clutched the grip of the unlit tactical flashlight, while her father's watch, enormous on her slender wrist, ticked off the seconds with a sound that seemed deafening in the sepulchral silence.

“Twenty meters to the generator room,” Lucas Riera whispered. His voice was deep, a vibration Elena felt more than heard.

The police officer limped slightly. The humidity and the barometric drop from the cyclogenesis punished his old injury, forcing him to drag his right leg with a syncopated rhythm: step, drag, step. He walked ahead, his broad silhouette outlined against the intermittent emergency lights, acting as a human shield Elena hadn't asked for but, at that moment, was grateful for with an acidic guilt in the pit of her stomach.

An aseptic, chemical smell pierced the air, stale with dust and humidity: mint and industrial disinfectant.

Elena stopped dead. Her moss-green eyes dilated, catching the detail before her brain processed the threat.

Too late.

A shadow detached itself from the darkness of a side niche. It wasn't a patch of light, but a solid figure, dressed in a fisherman's slicker that gleamed wetly under the electric flicker. The face didn't exist; there was only a modified welding mask, smooth and featureless.

In its hands, a red-handled fire axe was already describing a downward trajectory.

Time didn't stop, but rather accelerated its entropy.

“Get back!” Lucas roared.

The police chief tried to pivot, to interpose his body between the steel and the Profiler. He sought support from his right leg to push himself back, an instinctive defensive movement trained over years. But his knee, stiff from the cold and chronic pain, did not respond to the neural command.

The joint failed. A dry crack echoed as Lucas's support collapsed.

Instead of dodging the blow or blocking it with his forearm, Lucas slipped, falling heavily onto one knee. The change in height was catastrophic. The axe, originally aimed at his collarbone or neck, found a new target.

The tempered steel blade descended with the force of gravity and human malice.

The sound was atrocious. There was no metallic clang of a movie fight, but the wet, dense, and definitive sound of flesh violently separating. The blade bit deeply into Lucas's right thigh, tearing through the tactical pants, slicing the vastus medialis, and seeking the femur.

“AAAGH!”

Lucas’s cry tore through the corridor’s atmosphere, an animalistic shriek that froze Elena’s blood.

The masked figure, with mechanical efficiency, pulled the handle back to free the weapon. The extraction was worse than the impact. A gush of dark blood, almost black in the gloom, spurted from his injured limb, splattering the linoleum floor and Elena’s boots.

Lucas collapsed onto his side, his large, calloused hands flying instinctively to the wound, trying to contain the uncontainable. Blood flowed between his fingers with terrifying pressure.

The masked figure raised the axe again. The movement was deliberate, curatorial, like an artist examining where to apply the next brushstroke of red.

Elena reacted. There was no conscious thought, only the activation of muscle memory buried under layers of trauma. The paralyzing fear that usually haunted her transformed into cold fuel.

She lunged forward, not toward the aggressor, but toward a fire extinguisher hanging on the opposite wall. Her fingers closed around the cold metal lever. With a twist of her hip, she ripped the cylinder from its bracket and, leveraging the inertia, threw it with all her might at the figure in the slicker.

The red metal tank struck the aggressor in the chest, making him stagger and recoil two steps. The axe hit the floor, sparking, though he didn't let go of it.

“Come on!” Elena cried, her voice unrecognizable even to herself.

She grabbed Lucas by the lapel of his jacket. The man weighed a ton, dead weight anchored by pain and shock. He looked at her, his brown eyes wide with terror, pupils constricted by agony.

“Leave me…” he gasped, his complexion turning grayish. “Run.”

“Shut up and move,” she ordered.

Elena pulled. Adrenaline lent her a strength her slender muscles shouldn’t possess. Lucas, understanding she wouldn't leave, dug the heel of his good leg into the floor and pushed. They dragged themselves meter by meter, leaving a wide, glistening trail on the dirty floor.

The man in the slicker recovered, straightening up with the slowness of an inevitable nightmare.

Elena saw a metal door to her left: INFIRMARY.

“There!” she indicated.

They lunged against the door leaf. It was open. They tumbled inside, into a space that smelled of alcohol and old bandages. Elena kicked the door shut just as the shadow of the axe fell across the threshold.

She turned the lock and pushed a heavy metal filing cabinet against the entrance. A second later, a brutal blow shook the door, denting the metal from the outside. Then another. And silence.

Elena turned. Lucas lay in the center of the room, his back against a gurney. His breathing was wheezing, ragged. The puddle beneath his right leg grew with an obscene swiftness, devouring the white floor.

She knelt beside him. The wound was an open mouth in his thigh, a deep laceration that exposed muscular tissue and pulsed with every beat of Lucas's heart. It wasn't an injury a bandage could fix. Life was escaping him through that breach.

“Elena…” he murmured, his eyelids heavy, his crimson-stained hand seeking hers. “It’s cold.”

Elena looked around, her green eyes scanning the infirmary with the precision of a computer searching for data. Bandages, sutures… useless with this flow. She needed to stop the bleeding now.

Her gaze fell on a Bunsen burner on the laboratory table and a surgical metal spatula. Then, she looked back at the open wound, the torn flesh that wouldn't stop bleeding.

She understood what she had to do. Bile rose in her throat, but she swallowed it down.

“I’m sorry, Lucas,” she whispered, as she stood up to prepare the fire. “This is going to be hell.”

## Chapter 26: Sangre y Hielo

The infirmary hallway reeked of damp and neglect, but at that instant, the dominant smell was the hot copper of arterial blood.

Elena Vives dragged Lucas Riera’s dead weight. Her boots slid on the worn linoleum, leaving a scarlet trail that shimmered under the dying flicker of the emergency fluorescents. He was a large man, broad-shouldered and heavily built, a burden that strained every fiber of her muscles.

"Hold on!" Elena snarled, kicking open the double doors of the treatment room.

Lucas let out a guttural moan, a wet sound that escaped between his clenched teeth. His face, usually weathered by the mountain sun, was now the color of old wax. Cold sweat beaded on his forehead, mixing with the premature gray at his temples.

She let him drop onto the examination gurney with less gentleness than she would have liked. The police chief clung to the metal edges, his knuckles white, his brown eyes glassy and unfocused, searching the ceiling.

Elena focused on the source of the horror. It wasn't his shoulder, as she had feared in the confusion of the attack. The reality was worse.

His uniform trousers were shredded at the right thigh. The dark fabric was soaked, heavy, stuck to the skin by the viscosity of the vital fluid that gushed out in rhythmic spurts. Elena recalled with surgical clarity the preceding seconds in the corridor: the Sculptor's shadow emerging, the firefighter's axe whistling through the air. Lucas had tried to retreat, but his old injury, that cursed limp that the weather brought on, had betrayed him. His knee had given way and the steel, instead of finding air, had bitten deeply into his vastus medialis.

"Elena..." he whispered. His voice was a thread of sand.

She did not respond. Her analytical mind, trained to dissect the psychology of monsters, shifted gears. Now there was no profile to trace, only fluid mechanics and emergency anatomy.

She searched for scissors on the instrument table. They were rusted, useless. She cursed under her breath and pulled out her own tactical knife. With a sharp motion, she tore the fabric from knee to groin.

The wound opened before her eyes like an obscene mouth. The cut was clean at the edges, but deep, reaching dangerously close to the femoral artery. The blood wouldn't stop gushing, dark and fast, stealing Lucas's life with each beat of his heart.

"Press here," Elena ordered, guiding Lucas's large, calloused hands over the source of the bleeding. "Don't let go. If you let go, you die."

Elena stepped back and began rummaging through the metal and glass cabinets. The clatter of clashing bottles echoed in the small room, competing with the howl of the storm that battered the armored windows outside. The *White Beast* roared with hurricane force, isolating them from the world, from help, from hope.

Gauze. Bandages. A half-empty bottle of ethyl alcohol. No sutures. No anesthetic. No modern hemostatics.

"There's no... not enough pressure," Lucas gasped. His head fell back. The red stain beneath his hands expanded inexorably.

Elena looked at her father's watch on her left wrist. The second hand advanced with cruel indifference. At this rate, Lucas would go into irreversible hypovolemic shock in less than five minutes.

Her gaze swept the room in desperation until it stopped on a Bunsen burner connected to a gas outlet on the adjoining laboratory counter. Beside it, a long-handled surgical steel spatula.

The idea made her nauseous, a churning in her stomach she had to swallow back. It was an atrocity. A medieval butchery.

But it was the only option.

She ran towards the burner, turned the valve, and lit the flame. The blue flame hissed, hungry. Elena took the spatula and placed the flat blade over the tongue of fire.

"Lucas, listen to me," she said, returning to his side. She leaned over him, forcing him to look at her. Her moss-green eyes locked onto his brown ones, trying to anchor him to consciousness. "I'm going to have to close that up. Now."

He turned his head, saw the metal heating in the background, changing from silver to a menacing cherry red. He understood instantly.

"Do it," he said, closing his eyes tightly.

"It's going to hurt. More than you can imagine."

"Better than being dead," he murmured, though a solitary tear escaped his closed eyelid, getting lost in the lines of pain on his face.

Elena searched for something he could bite on. She found a roll of elastic bandage and put it in his mouth.

"Bite down. Don't scream if you can help it. We don't want him to come back."

She was referring to the Sculptor. The predator was still loose in the building, lurking in the shadows, waiting for the moment to claim his artwork.

Elena returned to the burner. The metal was incandescent, radiating a heat that dried her eyes. She wrapped her hand with a cloth to avoid burning herself on the conductive handle and took the spatula.

She walked towards the gurney. Each step was a sentence. The air in the room seemed to have solidified.

"On the count of three," she lied.

She abruptly pushed Lucas's bloodied hands away and, without giving his brain time to process the cruelty of the act, pressed the glowing red steel directly onto the open wound on his thigh.

The sound was the worst. A sharp hiss, like meat thrown into a boiling pan.

Immediately after, the smell. The acrid, dense stench of burning human flesh, mixed with the metallic sweetness of cooked blood and singed hair. It was a primitive aroma that awakened ancestral terrors in the reptilian brain.

Lucas arched on the gurney as if struck by lightning. His muscles convulsed violently. The scream was muffled by the gag, turning into a dull, vibrating howl that seemed to shake the walls of the infirmary. The veins in his neck swelled like ropes about to burst.

Elena maintained the pressure. Tears blurred her vision, but her hand didn't tremble. She had to cauterize every vessel, seal the torn flesh with fire.

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry," she whispered, a feverish litany he couldn't hear.

It was ten eternal seconds. Ten seconds in which time ceased to exist, and only absolute pain and the smell of death remained.

When she finally removed the metal, now black and smoking, the skin around the wound was puckered, blackened, and hideous, but the blood had stopped flowing. The red channel had become an artificial, grotesque scab.

Lucas collapsed onto the thin mattress. His chest rose and fell in irregular spasms, desperately searching for air. He was unconscious, or on the verge of it. The pain had surpassed the threshold of what the mind could process.

Elena dropped the tool to the floor with a metallic clang that broke the silence. She leaned against the edge of the gurney, fighting the dizziness that threatened to bring her down too.

She looked at her hands. They were covered in Lucas's blood. Dry, dark stains under her fingernails, fresh splatters on her forearms. The crescent-shaped scar on her left palm seemed to glow, a reminder of old violences.

With mechanical movements, she found a thermal blanket in the cabinets and covered the trembling body of the policeman. She checked his pulse at the carotid; it was fast, thready, but steady. He had survived.

Elena slid down the wall to sit on the cold floor, knees drawn to her chest. The adrenaline began to recede, leaving in its place an icy void and a leaden weariness.

Outside, the storm battered the building with renewed fury, as if the *White Beast* was frustrated at not having claimed a life that night. But Elena knew the night was long. The Sculptor was still out there, patient, meticulous. And now, Lucas was dead weight. She was the only barrier between him and eternal ice.

She looked towards the barricaded door. Her watch read three in the morning. Hours remained until dawn, and many more until the storm abated.

No one would come. They were alone in the white hell.

Elena closed her eyes for a moment, visualizing the building's map in her mind, tracing routes, calculating angles. The analyst was back. She had to be ready. Because when Lucas's pain subsided, or when the killer decided to finish his work, she would have to be colder than winter itself.

# CHAPTER 27: The Prey's Trail

**AIGÜESTORTES SANATORIUM, DECEMBER 25, 2018**

The smell of cauterized flesh clung to Elena Vives’s palate, a greasy, bitter film that not even the frigid air of the corridor could dissipate. She left behind the infirmary’s barricade, where Lucas’s rhythmic, heavy breathing marked the only beat of life in that concrete mausoleum. He would survive. That certainty was an anchor, but also a burden; now, every step she took into the darkness was not just a flight, but a hunt.

The flashlight in her right hand cast a trembling cone of light that cut through the blackness like a scalpel opening necrotic tissue. She ascended to the third floor. Her hiking boots, stained with soot and dried blood, landed on the tiles with an unnatural softness, learned not in the mountains, but during years of studying predatory behavior. To catch the monster, she had to move like him: without sound, without mercy, without fear. Or at least, pretending that fear wasn't a parasite devouring her stomach.

The building groaned. The beams contracted under the thermal pressure of the storm outside, emitting clicks that echoed like distant gunshots. Elena stopped at the foot of the service staircase leading to the upper levels, the forbidden ones, those not found on the valley’s tourist maps.

She glanced at her wristwach. Her father’s watch face, with its scratched crystal, showed ten o’clock in the morning, but daylight was a distant memory, drowned by the perpetual snowfall that sealed the windows. Inside, time had fractured.

She took the first step towards the fourth level and stopped dead.

Something in the air’s texture had changed. It wasn’t a sound, but an absence of suspended dust at a specific point in the beam of light. She narrowed her eyes, those moss-green irises that had analyzed hundreds of crime scenes, searching for the anomaly in the pattern.

There it was.

A fishing line, translucent and taut, crossed the third step at shin height. It was almost invisible, a ghostly trace awaiting an unwary leg.

Elena held her breath. She followed the fishing line’s path with her gaze, without touching it. The line ascended the banister, coiled into an improvised pulley system of rust and malice, and ended at the ceiling, supporting a block of masonry torn from the wall, bristling with twisted iron and broken glass. A guillotine of rubble.

“Primitive,” she whispered, and her own voice sounded strange, metallic to her.

It wasn't the work of an unreachable genius, but that of an engineer of pain. The Sculptor didn't just want to kill; he wanted to punish the intrusion.

With surgical precision, Elena lifted her left leg, clearing the deadly thread. Her balance wavered for an instant on her right leg, feeling the fatigue in her muscles, but she stabilized herself before placing her sole on the other side of the trap. She repeated the movement with her other limb.

Turning, she observed the mechanism from above. That trap confirmed her theory: he was upstairs. Nobody protects a path that leads nowhere. The predator had retreated to his highest lair.

She continued her ascent. The temperature dropped with each step. The mist from her mouth grew denser, a white cloud preceding her advance. The cold was no longer an environmental nuisance, but a physical assault, a bite on the exposed skin of her face.

Reaching the landing of the top floor, before the access to the clock tower, her flashlight beam swept across the rotten wooden floor.

A flash of color, incongruous in that world of grays and blacks, caught her attention.

She knelt, feeling the scar on her left palm throb, a phantom reminder of old wounds. On the floor, overturned on its side, lay a high-heeled shoe. It was made of fine, elegant leather, in a burgundy shade she had seen days earlier at an official reception.

The mayor’s shoe.

Elena shone her light on it closely. The heel was intact, but the sole showed deep grooves, longitudinal scratches. It hadn’t fallen off while walking. It had been dragged.

The revelation struck her with the force of a hammer blow.

“He doesn't hide them in the basement,” she murmured, and understanding chilled her blood more than the storm. “He elevates them.”

The Sculptor’s logic crystallized in her mind with terrifying clarity. Cold preserves. Ice stops putrefaction. He didn't want his works to rot in the dampness of the foundations; he sought the absolute purity of eternal freezing. And the coldest place in the sanatorium, the point where the wind lashed mercilessly and the temperature dropped below what was humanly bearable, was the clock tower. The attic.

She stood up slowly, leaving the shoe where it was. It was a breadcrumb in a forest of wolves.

Ahead of her, at the end of the corridor, stood a double-leaf door, massive, reinforced with black iron bands. The wood was covered in frost on the inside, proof that on the other side the climate did not obey the laws of central heating, but the tyranny of winter.

The wind howled through the cracks, a funereal chant inviting her in.

Elena advanced. The thirst for revenge that had propelled her out of the infirmary had transformed into something denser, more calculated. It was no longer fire; it was ice. She squeezed the handle of the scalpel she kept in her thermal jacket pocket until her knuckles turned white.

She reached the door.

There were no more visible traps. Only the wood, the iron, and the sepulchral silence waiting behind. She knew that crossing that threshold meant no return. There, logic ended and the artist’s delirium began.

She extended her hand towards the frozen doorknob. The metal burned her skin, a final warning from the physical world before entering the realm of madness.

She turned the handle.
```

## Chapter 28: El Tiempo Detenido

**Aigüestortes, December 25, 2018**
**Clock Tower**

The wind howled beyond the wood, an impatient beast clawing to get in, but the real cold didn't come from the storm. It resided within, crouched in the belfry's gloom. Elena pushed the oak door with her shoulder, keeping the scalpel held high, a trembling extension of her own will.

The screech of the rusted hinges tore through the silence like a choked cry.

No one attacked. No shadow lunged at her. Only dust, suspended in grayish beams of light filtering through the shutter cracks, danced with hypnotic slowness. The clock mechanism dominated the space: a tangle of immense, toothed bronze and iron gears, clattering with a rhythmic cadence, indifferent to human life. *Tick. Tock.* The mechanical heartbeat of the village.

Elena took a step. The plank floor groaned beneath her hiking boots. The air smelled of industrial oil, old wood, and something more. A pungent, clean scent, contrasting with the grime of the surroundings. Menthol. Antiseptic. The olfactory signature of the operating room.

She swung her flashlight beam towards the center of the room, where the ceiling beams converged into a dark apex.

Her breath froze in her throat, solidifying into a painful mass that prevented her from swallowing.

The mayor wasn't tied to a chair, nor was she discarded on the floor like refuse. She was displayed.

Suspended by a system of pulleys and fine chains that disappeared into the darkness of the upper rafters, the woman floated half a meter off the floor, slowly rotating on her own axis, propelled by air currents. She didn't look like a murder victim; she looked like a ballerina caught in the precise moment of an eternal leap.

Elena forced herself closer, fighting the primal instinct that screamed at her to turn back and flee into the snow. Her analytical mind, that tool she had honed for years to dissect human depravity, tried to take control. *Observe. Categorize. Don't feel.*

The mayor's skin was no longer human. It had taken on a bluish, translucent hue, similar to fine porcelain on the verge of shattering. Hoarfrost covered her completely, a dress of microscopic diamonds glinting under the artificial light of the flashlight. Her hair, blonde and stiff, formed a crown of ice needles around her head, tilted back in feigned ecstasy.

It was grotesque. And, in a sickening way that twisted Elena's guts, it was beautiful.

The Sculptor hadn't committed a crime of passion. He had curated a work of art. He had eliminated the imperfection of life—warmth, movement, chaos—to leave behind only pure form. Cadaveric rigidity had integrated into the pose: arms extended to the sides, palms open towards the ceiling as if begging or receiving an invisible blessing.

Elena lowered the flashlight, scanning the body. The clothes had been removed. The woman's nakedness wasn't vulnerable, but statuesque. There was no visible blood, no bruises, no signs of struggle. Only that absolute stillness, preserved by the attic's sub-zero temperature, which transformed a person into an object of macabre worship.

"My God..." she whispered, and her voice sounded strange, small against the magnitude of that tableau.

She moved close enough to see the victim's chest. It didn't move. Life had extinguished hours ago. The ice had claimed the flesh, sealing the pores, halting decomposition before it could begin. The glaciologist in her recognized the technique: rapid freezing, controlled humidity. The killer understood the thermodynamics of the human body better than many doctors.

Something white protruded from between the mayor's stiff, dead fingers. It wasn't ice.

It was paper.

Elena swallowed, tasting the metallic tang of fear at the back of her tongue. She tucked the scalpel into her anorak pocket, needing both hands for what was coming. Her gloved, clumsy fingers grazed the victim's skin. The touch was like feeling marble pulled from a freezer. The cold burn pierced through the fabric.

She gently pulled the note. The heavy-stock paper, similar to what would be used for a formal invitation, slid out with a dry rustle.

She brought it closer to the light. The calligraphy was impeccable, firm strokes of a fountain pen in black ink, without hesitation or blemish.

"Almost perfect. You are better."

The world tilted.

The words weren't a confession. They were a promise. An invitation. The mayor was just a draft, a dress rehearsal before the definitive creation. And the raw material for that final work had just voluntarily entered the artist's studio.

The impact of the phrase hit Elena with the force of a physical hammer blow to the solar plexus. The analytical barrier, that wall of tempered glass she had built between herself and the horror, shattered into a thousand pieces.

Biological reality superseded the intellectual.

That menthol scent became unbearable, mingling with the imagined stench of her own future death. She felt a violent contraction in her stomach, a spasm that climbed burning up her esophagus like acidic lava.

She doubled over at the waist, dropping the note.

Violent retching seized her. Elena vomited onto the old wooden floor, expelling bitter bile and her meager breakfast, emptying herself of everything except panic. The sound of her own retching echoed in the belfry, competing with the clock's relentless *tick-tock*.

She coughed, spitting a string of saliva, and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand, trembling uncontrollably. Her eyes, swimming with tears of exertion, fixed again on the suspended figure. The mayor was still there, pivoting imperceptibly, watching her with those open, glassy, empty eyes, as if welcoming her to the museum.

She was alone.
The killer wasn't there, but his gaze filled everything.
And she was the next piece for the collection.

## Chapter 29: Decisiones en Frío

CHAPTER 29: Cold Decisions

Aigüestortes Spa, Catalan Pyrenees
Day 6. 4:45 PM

The outside world had ceased to exist. Beyond the reinforced glass of the infirmary, reality had shrunk to a monochrome concept: white. A voracious, absolute white, devouring the contours of the fir trees and blurring the line where sky should meet earth. The storm wasn't falling; it was pushing. It was a physical beast ramming against the hotel's stone walls, searching for a crack to slip through and reclaim what remained inside.

Elena Vives tore her gaze away from that aggressive nothingness and turned to the bed.

The silence in the room smelled of iodine and stale hopelessness. Lucas Riera sat on the edge of the mattress, his right leg stretched out at a rigid, unnatural angle. The bandage, clean just hours ago, already displayed the dark bloom of a fresh bloodstain, a geographical map of the pain he tried to conceal by clenching his jaw until the muscles in his neck tightened like violin strings about to snap.

"I know where he is," Elena said.

Her voice sounded strange in her own ears, devoid of vibration, as if the words were stones she was dropping into a dry well. There was no triumph in the revelation, only the fatality of a terminal diagnosis.

Lucas looked up. His dark eyes, usually warm, were now two tunnels of weariness. The gray hairs at his temples seemed to have multiplied in the last twenty-four hours, a personal snowfall mimicking the one outside.

"The caves on the north slope," he deduced. It wasn't a question. It was the confirmation of a police officer who knew his territory better than the lines on his own hands. "The old natural ice houses."

"The temperature there is constant. Perfect for preserving... materials." Elena avoided the word *bodies*. Her analyst's mind was already there, visualizing the scene, anticipating the arrangement of horrors the Sculptor would have prepared. Her father's watch, large and heavy on her left wrist, ticked off the seconds with a *tick-tock* that resonated in her bones, reminding her that time was not a renewable resource.

"I'm coming with you."

The phrase left Lucas's mouth with the speed of a reflex, but it lacked foundation.

"No, Lucas."

"I'm not letting you go out there alone. That bastard is waiting for you. It's a trap, Elena. All of this..."—he made a vague gesture encompassing the hotel, the storm, the accumulated bodies—"this is his stage. And you're the lead actress."

"Exactly. That's why I have to go."

Lucas growled, an animal sound born of the deepest frustration, the kind that corrodes the dignity of men accustomed to being others' shields. He pressed his calloused palms against the edge of the mattress and pushed his body upwards.

It was an act of rebellion against biology.

Elena didn't move to help him. She knew he wouldn't forgive it. She watched, with a clinical coldness that stung her chest, as the mechanics of the human body failed.

Lucas managed to stand for an instant. One glorious, pathetic second. Then, he shifted his weight to his right leg.

There was no scream. The sound was worse: a choked gasp, air escaping his lungs as if he'd been punched in the solar plexus. His knee, that complex hinge of tendons and bone, collapsed under gravity. His leg didn't support him; it buckled like a rotten branch.

He fell heavily. The thud against the linoleum floor sounded like defeat.

Elena closed her eyes for an instant, feeling the impact in her own nervous system, a sympathetic jolt of phantom pain. When she opened them, Lucas was on the floor, pounding the floorboards with a clenched fist. One, two, three times. His knuckles turned white.

"Shit," he whispered, his voice broken by humiliation. "Shit, shit!"

Elena approached and knelt beside him. She didn't touch him. Not yet. She respected the sacred space of his helplessness.

"Your leg won't hold up in the snow, Lucas. There's more than a meter out there. You need strength, balance. Right now, you have neither."

He looked at her. There were tears of contained rage in the corners of his eyes.

"If you go alone, he'll kill you. He's stronger. He knows the terrain."

"I know his mind," she retorted, and for the first time, she allowed the arrogance of her old life, the confidence of the profiler who had hunted monsters in air-conditioned offices, to seep into her voice. "I know how he thinks. I know what he needs to complete his work. His narcissism is his blind spot. He expects me to come scared, like a victim. He doesn't expect me to come as an equal."

She stood up, leaving Lucas on the floor, and headed towards the supply cabinet where they had stacked the equipment recovered from the reception area.

The ritual began.

It wasn't dressing; it was armoring herself. Each garment was a layer of insulation not only against the cold, but against fear.

First, the thermal clothing, clinging to her skin like a synthetic second skin. Then, the thick wool sweater, rough, smelling of mothballs. The waterproof pants hissed as she zipped them up, a sharp, definitive sound.

She pulled on her hiking boots. She laced them tightly, constricting her instep until foot and sole were a single entity. Each knot was a promise of no return. Finally, the red anorak. The color of blood, of warning. She pulled up the collar and felt her peripheral vision narrow. Only what was in front existed now.

When she turned, Lucas had managed to drag himself back to the bed. He sat, pale, with cold sweat beading on his forehead despite the low temperature of the room.

"You look like..."—Lucas searched for the word, his gaze tracing her figure—"You look like a soldier."

"It is a war, isn't it?"

Elena approached the bed. The space between them, once filled with unspoken words and professional tensions, had become charged with a different electricity. The imminence of the end has a way of distilling human relationships, evaporating the superfluous and leaving only the pure residue of truth.

Lucas reached under the pillow. The movement was slow, solemn. He pulled out his service weapon. A Glock 19, black, matte, utilitarian. An instrument of death designed with Austrian engineering precision.

He held it in the palm of his enormous hand, offering it to her as one would deliver a sacred relic.

"Take off the safety," he said, his voice hoarse. "Aim for center mass. Don't hesitate. If you see a shadow, shoot. If you hear a sound that isn't the wind, shoot."

Elena took the weapon. The metal was warm from having been under his head. It was heavy. Heavier than she remembered from her shooting practice at the academy, years ago. It was heavy with the responsibility of survival. She checked the magazine with a dry, mechanical motion. Full.

"I will."

She put the pistol in the deep pocket of her anorak, next to the flashlight and the knife. Her right hand brushed the grip, memorizing its rough texture.

Silence fell. The wind howled outside, rattling the window frames, reminding them that time was up.

Lucas reached out and took her hand. His skin was rough, warm. Elena's, cold as the ice she was about to face. He gently pulled her closer. Elena didn't resist. The gravity between them had shifted its axis.

"Elena," he said. Her name sounded different on his lips, stripped of ranks and formalities. "Promise me one thing."

"What?"

"That you won't let him turn you into one of his statues. That if you can't win..."

He didn't finish the sentence. There was no need. The plea hung in the air, brutal and honest. *Don't let him capture you alive.*

"I promise."

Their faces were inches apart. She could see the map of wrinkles around Lucas's eyes, the small scar on his chin, the furious pulse beating in his neck. He leaned in and kissed her.

It wasn't a gentle kiss. There was no romantic movie tenderness. It was a collision. It was desperate, tasting of blood from a bitten lip, of stale coffee and fear. It was the kiss of two people on the edge of an abyss, trying to anchor themselves to each other before the fall became inevitable. It lasted a second and it lasted an eternity. When they pulled apart, both were breathless.

Elena broke away abruptly, severing the physical bond before the temptation to stay, to hide under the blankets and wait for the end together, could paralyze her. The 'paralysis of analysis' was her old enemy, but today there was no room for thought, only for kinetic action.

"Wait for me awake," she ordered, her voice firm, reclaiming her mask.

"Always," he replied. A white lie. With that leg, with infection lurking, he might not wake up if he closed his eyes.

Elena walked towards the infirmary door that led to the side corridor, the service exit connecting to the outside. She placed her hand on the doorknob. The metal was icy, burning her fingertips even through the thin gloves she wore beneath the thick ones.

She looked back one last time. Lucas Riera, Aigüestortes' chief of police, the man who had maintained order in the valley, was now a broken figure on white sheets, a fallen giant watching her with the devotion of one who sees their only hope depart.

"Lock up as soon as I'm out," she said.

"Good luck, Elena."

She turned the knob. Pushed.

The wind didn't enter; it invaded. A blast of icy air, laden with microscopic ice needles, struck her face like a physical slap, stealing her breath instantly. The roar of the storm drowned out any other sound.

Elena Vives stepped forward, crossing the threshold. The door clicked shut behind her with a metallic snap, leaving her alone in the white belly of the storm. There was no turning back now. Ariadne's thread had been cut.

## Chapter 30: El Reino Blanco

**Valle de Boí, Catalan Pyrenees**
**December 26, 2018**

The world had ceased to be a place of shapes and contours, transforming instead into an absolute concept: white.

There was no sky, no earth, no horizon. Only a furious, milky mass swallowing reality whole. Upon leaving the shelter, the transition hadn't been gradual; it was like crossing the threshold of an airlock into the void outside. The wind wasn't blowing; it was pushing with the solidity of a moving concrete wall, an invisible giant trying to knock me down with every step.

I adjusted my blizzard goggles, but the snow embedded itself in the glass with the violence of sand blasted under pressure. Beneath layers of thermal clothing and a technical anorak, my body was a small boiler struggling to maintain its inner fire against an ocean of entropy. Lucas's service pistol, heavy and cold against my hip, felt like a ridiculous talisman. What was I going to shoot at? The tempest? Winter itself?

Nature needed no weapons to kill; its indifference was enough.

I moved forward. Or so I believed. The notion of distance had evaporated along with visibility. My boots sank calf-deep into the virgin snow, and each time I lifted a leg, the effort burned in my quadriceps like boiling lactic acid. The roar of the air was so deafening that, paradoxically, it created an absolute mental silence. There was no room for analytical fear, only for the mechanics of survival: lift, move forward, step. Lift, move forward, step.

I remembered the topographical map I'd memorized at the shelter's kitchen table. The entrance to the caves in the northern sector should have been less than two kilometers away. On a summer day, a thirty-minute walk. Today, it was an odyssey across a hostile planet.

A side gust of wind, crueler than the previous ones, made me lose my balance. I fell to my knees. The impact wasn't hard; the snow cushioned it, but the cold took advantage of that momentary pause to seep through the seams of my clothing. I felt its icy fingers caressing the nape of my neck, seeking a path to my spine.

“Get up,” I ordered myself, but my voice was lost before it escaped my scarf.

When I looked up, the landmark I'd been following—a cluster of black fir trees standing like deformed sentinels to my right—had vanished.

I turned my head. Nothing. Only that thick, swirling white curtain, blurring the surroundings a meter from my nose. Panic, that creature I'd kept at bay with logic and police procedure, began to claw at the walls of my stomach. Without visual references, human balance fails. The inner ear becomes confused. I could be walking in circles, or worse, heading towards one of the precipices that flanked the invisible path.

I looked at my father's watch on my wrist. The hands advanced with an insulting normalcy. Forty minutes had passed. I should have arrived. Or, at least, I should have seen the rock formations that preceded the entrance.

Doubt settled in my lungs, heavier than the freezing air. I pulled off a glove with my teeth—an immediate tactical error—to take out the compass from my pocket. The needle danced erratically, as if the mountain's magnetism were drunk.

“North,” I whispered, watching my breath crystalize instantly.

But north was merely an abstract concept when the wind struck you from all directions. I put my glove back on, but my fingers were already numb, clumsy as wet pieces of wood. Hypothermia doesn't strike suddenly; it seduces you. It convinces you that you're tired, that sitting down for a moment isn't such a bad idea.

I kept walking, guided solely by a blind obstinacy and the image of Lucas, wounded and helpless in the infirmary. His limp, his beaten-dog look when I took his weapon. He trusted that I was stronger than this.

Then I saw it.

About ten meters away, a dark silhouette stood out against the infinite whiteness.

I stopped, my heart thudding against my ribs like a trapped bird. My hand instinctively went to the pistol grip beneath my coat. The figure was motionless, tall, with slumped shoulders.

“Lucas?” I yelled, knowing it was impossible. He couldn't walk.

The figure didn't respond. The wind whipped what appeared to be a cloak or a long coat. I took a step, squinting my moss-green eyes, searching for definition in that blur. It wasn't Lucas. The posture was rigid, unnatural.

It was the girl. The victim of the failed case. The one I'd let die by not seeing the signs in time. She stood there, in the snow, pointing into the void with an accusing arm.

I squeezed my eyes shut and shook my head, feeling the sharp ache of cold in my cheekbones. “Hypoxia. You're hallucinating. Your brain seeks patterns where there's only chaos.” When I opened them again, the figure had disintegrated. It wasn't a woman, nor a ghost. It was a dry tree trunk, split by some ancient lightning, protruding from the snow like a broken rib of the mountain.

Disappointment and relief mingled in a bitter cocktail. There was no one. I was alone on that immense snowy canvas. But that hallucination had served a purpose: the trunk marked the forest's edge. If my mental map wasn't deceiving me, the rock face had to be right behind it.

I advanced towards the dead tree, using it as a buoy in the wreckage. Upon reaching it, I touched the rough wood. It was real. Solid. I leaned against it, panting, and looked beyond.

There it was.

It wasn't a majestic entrance. Barely an irregular crack at the base of a gray granite cliff, an open wound in the stone that the snow hadn't quite managed to cauterize. The darkness emanating from within was absolute, a violent contrast to the blinding luminosity outside. It looked like a mouth waiting to be fed.

The physical relief was so intense it almost made me vomit. I dragged myself the last few meters, battling against the snow that had accumulated at the entrance, forming a treacherous dune. My legs no longer responded fluidly; they were dead weights I had to drag with the strength of my hips.

I let myself fall inside, rolling onto the cold, dry stone.

The change was instantaneous. The roar of the wind died down, becoming a distant, muffled howl, as if someone had closed a heavy door. The air inside was still. Not warm, not even temperate, but the absence of the biting wind felt like an embrace.

I stayed on the ground for a moment, my cheek pressed against the dusty rock. It smelled of ancient dampness, of minerals, and something more… a subtle metallic scent that made the hairs on my neck stand on end.

I switched on the flashlight with trembling hands. The beam of light cut through the gloom, revealing limestone walls that sweated dampness. I was inside.

I sat up, hugging my knees to conserve residual heat. I was frozen to the bone. My teeth chattered with a rhythm I couldn't control. But I was alive. I had vanquished the storm, the White Beast guarding the valley.

Now I had to face what dwelled within.

I gazed into the blackness that stretched beyond the circle of my flashlight's beam. The cave's silence was dense, expectant. It wasn't an empty refuge. It felt inhabited, watched.

I drew Lucas's pistol from its holster, released the safety with my numb thumb, and aimed at nothing.

“I'm here,” I whispered into the void, and my voice bounced off the walls, distorted, returning an echo that sounded like a threat.

## Chapter 31: La Galería

North Sector Caves, Valle de Arán
December 26, night

The silence weighed more heavily than the snow.

Elena moved forward, dragging her numb feet across the bare rock. Behind her, the roar of the white beast, that storm scratching at the mountain's entrance like a frustrated predator that had lost its prey, had faded. Inside, the stillness was not peace, but a malevolent expectation. A waiting.

She switched on her flashlight. The beam of light cut through the dense darkness, revealing dust particles dancing in the stagnant air like suicidal moths. Her fingers, stiff inside her technical gloves, closed around the grip of Lucas's pistol. The metal offered a cold comfort, a promise of defense that felt useless against the magnitude of the blackness swallowing the tunnel.

She walked.

Each step echoed with a damp acoustics, amplified by the limestone walls that seemed to close in on her shoulders. Claustrophobia, that old acquaintance nestled in her chest since the Minnesota case, awoke. Not as a scream, but as hydraulic pressure at the base of her throat. She breathed through her mouth, trying to fool the panic, but the air tasted wrong.

It didn't smell of dampness, nor of wet earth, nor of rancid bat guano.

It smelled of mint. And beneath that chemical, aggressive, antiseptic freshness, the cloying stench of flesh, when it ceases to be life and becomes mere matter, crawled.

The tunnel suddenly widened. The ceiling rose until it was lost in the upper shadows, and the temperature dropped sharply, not with the violence of the outside wind, but with the absolute stillness of an industrial cold storage unit. The vapor of her breath froze before her eyes before dissipating.

Elena swept the space with the cone of light.

She stopped dead. Her boots scraped against the floor, which was no longer irregular rock, but had been leveled, polished with manic dedication.

"My God!" she whispered. Her voice had no echo; the ice absorbed everything.

She wasn't in a cavern. She was in a cathedral.

On both sides of a central aisle, arranged with sickening symmetry, rectangular blocks stood tall. Translucent monoliths, two meters high. They gleamed under the flashlight's beam with a bluish, almost radioactive glow.

She forced herself to approach the first one in the left row. Fear tightened the muscles in her neck like steel cables about to snap.

She wiped the frost from the surface with her coat sleeve. Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic drum threatening to betray her position. She raised the light.

Inside the ice, suspended in eternal weightlessness, was a hand.

Only a hand.

It was preserved with an obscene perfection. Fingers extended in a gesture of supplication or reach, the skin pale, the nails with a purplish hue beneath the layer of clear polish. The cut at the wrist was surgical, clean, without tears. There was no blood. The ice had cauterized the history, halting decomposition at the exact second beauty met death.

Elena stumbled back, tripping over her own feet. The light swung violently, illuminating the rest of the gallery.

It wasn't the only piece. There were dozens.

She walked down the aisle, bile burning her esophagus. The next block contained a female torso, nude, marmoreal, with the ribcage opened and ribs separated by silver retractors, exposing lungs that would never breathe again. Beyond that, a face. A young man, with wide, blue eyes, injected with a solution that preserved the sparkle of life long after the soul had fled.

It was a museum.

A gallery of atrocities where the artistic medium was not oil or marble, but human biology halted in time. The Sculptor didn't kill for sadistic pleasure; he killed for curation. He sought the preservation of the instant, the Pyrrhic victory over entropy. Each block was either a failure or a success in his quest for physical immortality.

The impact of the vision made her legs falter. Reality fractured. This was not the work of a common serial killer; it was the labor of years, perhaps decades, of technical refinement. The logistics required to maintain that temperature, to transport the bodies, to create the molds... the sheer magnitude of the operation crushed her more than the mountain above her.

She reached the end of the main hall.

There, the space opened into a sort of natural apse. There was no ice in the center, only a raised stone platform, illuminated by a faint light coming from an opening at the back, suggesting an adjoining room with electrical power.

On the platform stood an empty pedestal.

It was a slab of black granite, polished into a dark mirror. It waited. It demanded.

Elena approached, drawn by a morbid gravity she couldn't resist. The flashlight trembled in her left hand, making the shadows of the stalagmites dance like hungry specters.

On the surface of the pedestal, carved with a chisel and filled with gold leaf, was a metal plaque. Small. Elegant. Definitive.

She read the inscription. The air rushed out of her lungs and refused to re-enter.

"ELENA VIVES
The Final Piece"

Reality swayed beneath her feet. She wasn't an intruder. She wasn't the hunter who had followed breadcrumbs to the witch's house.

She was the commission.

Everything—the call, the clues, the storm, the route that had led her there—had been a design. A macabre choreography orchestrated to bring her to this exact spot, in front of that empty pedestal awaiting her form, her final gesture, her frozen eternity.

Her wrist watch, her father's old analog, marked the seconds with a *tick-tock* that sounded deafening in the sepulchral silence. *Tick*. You're here. *Tock*. It's your turn.

An electric hum broke the trance.

At the back, behind the pedestal, a heavy metal door hissed open hydraulically. A white, clinical, blinding light spilled from within, cutting through the gallery's gloom like a scalpel on taut skin.

Elena raised her weapon towards the light, squinting against the sudden glare. Her pupils painfully contracted.

The laboratory was open.

## Chapter 32: Cara a Cara

Central Laboratory, Aigüestortes Valley Cave System
December 26, 2018

It wasn't the light itself that hurt, but its purity.

After hours spent crawling through galleries where darkness had weight and texture, where shadows clung to the skin like tar, the radiance emanating from the central cavern felt like a physical assault. Elena Vives blinked, feeling reflexive tears bathe her retinas, trying to focus on that impossible scene.

There were no stalactites dripping moisture, nor the geological chaos of limestone. The floor had been leveled with a grayish, industrial resin, upon which stainless steel tables rested, arranged with the precision of an operating room. A generator purred in some hidden corner, a mechanical, constant, and deep throb, replacing the mountain's pulse. But what dominated the air wasn't the ozone from the machinery, but that scent. Menthol. Chemical eucalyptus. An aggressive asepsis that tried, unsuccessfully, to mask the ferrous smell of old blood.

And there he was.

He didn't turn when she crossed the threshold. He remained with his back to her, leaning over a workbench, manipulating an object with a watchmaker's delicacy. He wore an immaculate white coat, which contrasted violently with the surrounding black rock. His ash blonde hair, so pale it seemed to lack pigment, was styled with geometric precision.

Elena raised the pistol. Lucas's service weapon weighed more than she remembered, or perhaps her own muscles had lost the ability to hold reality. The barrel's metal was cold, but her palm sweated against the grip. She aimed at the center of that pristine back.

"Don't move," her voice sounded raw, like sandpaper against her dry throat.

The man stopped his hands, but he didn't tense up. There was no instinctive spasm of someone who knows they are hunted. He simply ceased what he was doing with a calm that chilled the blood more than the cave's sub-zero temperature.

"Punctuality was never your strong suit in college, Elena," he said. His voice was soft, devoid of sharp edges, with a baritone cadence that echoed off the stone walls. "But I suppose the weather complicated the ascent."

He turned slowly.

Elena held her breath, searching for the monster's face. What she found was the most terrifying normalcy. Symmetrical, unremarkable features, the kind the mind forgets five seconds after seeing them in a supermarket line. Only his eyes broke that mask of mediocrity: two pools of ice blue, static, devoid of any spark of humanity. They were shark's eyes, made to observe, not to feel.

The Sculptor.

He wore no visible weapons. He only held in his right hand, gloved in blue latex, a small carving tool, similar to a scalpel, but with a curved blade.

"Drop it," she ordered, taking a step forward to steady her stance. Her hiking boots squeaked on the resin.

He smiled, a minimal gesture that barely curved his thin lips. He placed the instrument on the metallic table with a soft clink. Then, he extended his hands, palms up, in a gesture that wasn't surrender, but welcome. Like a host receiving a late guest at a gala dinner.

"There's no need for so much hostility. You're trembling, and that trigger is sensitive. It would be a shame to spoil the moment with a vulgar accident."

"The moment?" Elena felt a wave of bile rise in her esophagus. She thought of the previous gallery, of the ice blocks, of the faces preserved in eternal agony. "You call that carnage a 'moment'?"

The man shook his head, paternalistic disappointment shadowing his gaze.

"Carnage is what nature does, Elena. Putrefaction. Worms. Oblivion. I offer permanence." He walked around the table, approaching her with measured steps. "Lower the weapon. You haven't come all this way to kill me. You've come to understand."

"I've come to put an end to this."

"If you wanted to shoot, you would have already. You're an analyst, a profiler. Your mind needs to complete the pattern before closing it. You can't destroy the unknown without first solving the equation. It's your nature."

Elena kept the gun's sights aligned with the man's chest. He was right, and that terrified her. Her index finger caressed the trigger guard, hesitating. Fear wasn't paralysis, but a high-frequency vibration that ran through her nerves, warning her that she was facing a predator who used words, not claws.

"If you take one more step, I'll blow your head off," she warned.

The Sculptor stopped three meters away. He casually leaned against one of the tables, crossing his ankles. Behind him, Elena could see what he had been manipulating: a cubic ice block, about thirty centimeters. Inside, suspended in the crystalline transparency, was a human hand. The fingers were extended, graceful, captured in a gesture of supplication or surrender. It didn't look dead; it looked paused.

"Why?" she asked, the word escaping her lips before she could censor it.

"The million-dollar question." The man sighed, observing his work. "People fear death, but what truly terrifies them is deterioration. To see beauty wither, skin wrinkle, identity dissolve into a biological soup." He looked up and fixed his blue eyes on hers. "I stop the clock. I turn the ephemeral into the absolute. Isn't that what every artist seeks?"

"You're a psychopath," Elena spat. The clinical label served as a shield, a way to reduce him to a known, manageable pathology.

"Labels are for the mediocre who need to categorize what surpasses them." He made a vague gesture with his hand, encompassing the laboratory. "You're not like them, Elena. That's why you're here. That's why you are the final piece."

The air in Elena's lungs solidified. The 'Final Piece'. The phrase she had intuited, had feared, now spoken with that casual certainty.

"Have you been watching me?"

"For years." The confession landed like a slab. "Not your daily movements, that's vulgar. I've read your work. Your thesis on the morphology of Pyrenean glaciers. Your articles on isotope preservation in permafrost."

Elena felt the ground sway. It wasn't a physical pursuit; it was an intellectual violation. He hadn't chosen her for her appearance, or by chance. He had entered her mind long before entering her life.

"You understand ice, Elena," he continued, his voice taking on an almost religious fervor. "You know that frozen water is the only true memory of this planet. Rock erodes, wood rots, paper burns. But ice... ice remembers. Every air bubble trapped ten thousand years ago is still there, intact. You seek truth in glaciers. I seek truth in flesh. We are colleagues."

"Don't compare me to you," she growled, gripping the weapon until her knuckles turned white. "I study nature. You torture people."

"I save them," he corrected vehemently, losing his icy composure for a second. "I save them from the ugliness of the end. Think of that girl you found in the forest. If I hadn't intervened, she would now be dust and bones. Thanks to me, she will be perfect forever. Incorruptible."

Elena remembered the first victim's body. The unnatural serenity of her face. The absence of visible violence, save for the fact that she was dead. She felt a deep, intellectual nausea. The man's logic was a labyrinth of broken mirrors, where cruelty disguised itself as pity.

"And now you want me," she said, connecting the dots. "Not just for your collection. But because you think... I appreciate it."

"You are the only one who can understand the magnitude of my work." The Sculptor moved away from the table and took a slow step towards her. "The others... they were blank canvases. Raw material. But you... you are a mirror. Your mind is cold, analytical, precise. Like this place. Like me. To preserve you would not just be to keep a body; it would be to crystallize a kindred intelligence. It would be the culmination of my museum."

Elena backed up one step, colliding with the edge of an empty autopsy table. The frigid steel pressed into her lower back. She was cornered between the man's moral abyss and the metal of his laboratory.

The temptation to shoot was overwhelming. A single movement of her finger and the brain that conceived those horrors would cease to function. But something stopped her. It wasn't compassion. It was the need to know where Lucas was. If she shot now, and Lucas was trapped in one of those capsules, dying of cold, she would never find him in time. The laboratory was a complex of tunnels; she needed information.

"Where is he?" she asked, changing the subject, trying to regain control of the interrogation.

The Sculptor tilted his head, like a curious dog.

"The policeman. The rough and sentimental Chief Riera." He clicked his tongue. "A discordant element. Too... organic. Too chaotic. He doesn't fit the aesthetic."

"Where is he?!" Elena shouted. The echo of her voice bounced off the polished rock walls.

"Close." He gestured vaguely towards a metallic door at the back of the laboratory, shrouded in gloom. "He is experiencing the process. The thermal transition. It's fascinating, you know? The body struggles, shivers, burns its last glucose reserves. It's biology's final dance resisting eternity."

Elena's heart beat against her ribs like a caged bird. 'Thermal transition.' He was freezing. Lucas was dying right now, just a few meters from her.

Urgency replaced fear. She had to get past this man.

Discreetly, with a movement she hoped would be imperceptible under the overhead light, Elena slid her thumb over the gun's safety. It was already off; she'd checked it upon entering, but she needed to feel the mechanism. She readjusted her grip. She couldn't fail. At this distance, a shot to the chest would take him down, but perhaps not kill him instantly if he wore some kind of protection under his pristine coat. The head. It had to be the head.

The Sculptor saw the micro-movement of her hand. His blue eyes shone with predatory intelligence.

"You're going to try," he said, not as a question, but as a statement of fact. "You're going to try to kill me to save a man already marked by decay. He's sick, Elena. You've seen it in his gait, in the tremor of his hands. His own body is betraying him. I'm just accelerating the inevitable."

Sick? Elena's mind flashed to Lucas's limp, the pills he took in secret. The Sculptor knew too much. He had dissected their lives before dissecting their bodies.

"Philosophy class is over," Elena said, tensing her arm muscles. The decision was made. Lucas was worth more than any ethical answer.

But before she could pull the trigger, the sound changed.

The generator's constant hum coughed. The laboratory's white lights flickered once, twice. The intensity dropped, plunging the room into a grayish gloom for a second, before recovering its full power.

That brief instant of electrical instability was enough.

The Sculptor moved. Not with superhuman speed, but with calculated efficiency. He exploited the flicker of light that had distracted Elena for a fraction of a second. He took two long, fluid steps, closing the distance between them.

Elena reacted, but time had strangely stretched and contracted. She raised the weapon, seeking her target, but he was already too close. He didn't hit her. He stopped just at the limit of her personal space, invading her sphere of safety with his scent of mint and death.

She could see the pores of his skin, the almost synthetic texture of his epidermis. She could see that his pupils hadn't dilated even at the imminent threat of the shot.

"Shoot," he whispered. His voice was an intimate, seductive, and terrible hiss. "Shoot and break the silence. But if you do, the location of the freezing chamber dies with me. And your policeman will become an ice statue before you find the key."

Elena froze. Her finger on the trigger trembled, applying pounds of pressure that didn't quite release the firing pin. The gun barrel was centimeters from the chest of his pristine coat.

They were caught in a stalemate. She had the firepower; he held control of the information. And both knew that time was running out for Lucas, tick-tock, tick-tock, like the progressive cooling of a cell.

"You're a monster," she whispered, feeling tears of frustration burn her eyes.

"I am a visionary, Elena." The Sculptor slowly raised a hand and, with a boldness that defied all logic of survival, gently pushed the gun barrel aside, millimeter by millimeter. Elena resisted, but doubt weakened her arms. "And you are about to become my masterpiece."

They were face to face. His breath didn't mist, as if his interior was as cold as the cave. Hers came out in ragged clouds. Intimate enemies, united by a perverse understanding of ice and death, separated only by an impossible decision.

The generator coughed again, louder this time, and the light flickered, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to applaud the scene.

## Chapter 33: Laberinto de Espejos

**Aigüestortes, December 26, 2018**
**Karstic System Tunnels**

The shot thundered in the stone cavity, a dull blast that found no flesh, but the millennia-old hardness of the rock. The bullet ricocheted, sparking orange flames that died before touching the ground, and the echo multiplied like a geological guffaw, mocking my aim.

The Sculptor didn't flinch. He didn't even blink. With a fluidity that contradicted the violence of the moment, he spun on his heels, his white coat billowing like a spectral shroud, and slipped into the black maw of the east tunnel.

"Stop!" I cried, but my voice sounded fragile, swallowed by the cavern's acoustics.

I couldn't let him go. He held the key, the only one who knew the code. Lucas was turning into an ice statue a few feet away, and every second I hesitated, his cells broke, crystallizing irreversibly. The image of his lungs collapsing spurred me forward, forcing my legs to run after the trail of mint and formaldehyde scent the killer left in his wake.

I exited the makeshift laboratory and ventured into the mountain's gullet.

The change was immediate. If the operating room possessed a clinical, artificial coldness, the tunnels exhaled the damp, rotten breath of the deep earth. The floor was a trap of uneven calcite, slippery from centuries of seepage. My flashlight beam danced chaotically, cutting through the shadows with a trembling ray that barely managed to penetrate the thick air.

I saw him at the end of a bend, a pale blur moving with an irritating grace. He wasn't running; he flowed. He knew every crack, every stalagmite that sprouted from the ground like a shark's tooth waiting to tear an unwary ankle. I, on the other hand, was an intruder, a foreign body the cave tried to expel.

My mountain boots, designed for the snow outside, found no traction in the damp slime of the inner rock. As I tried to gain speed on a sharp turn, my right foot slipped on a patch of subterranean moss.

The world spun.

There was no time to put out my hands. My side violently collided with a sharp stone edge protruding from the wall. The air escaped my lungs in a choked groan. I felt the tearing of thermal clothing and, an instant later, the sharp, hot, liquid burning sensation of my skin splitting open at rib-height.

I lay gasping against the rock, the metallic taste of bile in my mouth. Lucas's pistol, heavy and cold, was still in my right hand, but my fingers had lost sensation. I touched my side with my left; the dampness I collected wasn't water.

I looked up. He had stopped ten meters ahead, just at the threshold where the tunnel widened into a gallery full of natural columns. He wasn't fleeing. He was waiting for me.

A terrible understanding settled in my stomach, heavier than fear: he wasn't running blindly. Every step of his was a calculated choreography. I stumbled over the cave's geography; he, on the other hand, used it as an extension of his body.

I stood up, ignoring the stabbing pain that drilled through my torso with each inhalation. I limped forward, aiming the weapon at his silhouette.

"It's over," I said, trying to steady my aim.

He cocked his head, an almost childish gesture of curiosity. He stood next to a rustic control panel, a rusted fuse box attached to the rock wall, probably installed by the smugglers who used these caves decades ago.

"Elena," his voice was clear, without the panting of physical exertion, "you're trying to apply surface logic in the depths. Down here, sight is a luxury, not a right."

I looked around. The gallery was a forest of stone. Gigantic stalactites hung from the ceiling like spears pointing at my head. I needed cover. If he decided to attack, I was exposed in the middle of the corridor.

I lunged towards a limestone rock column, seeking shelter. In the movement, I struck a thin formation, a young stalactite that broke with a dry crack. The fragment, long and conical like a bone dagger, fell into my free hand. I gripped it tightly. A pistol with few bullets and a sharp stone. These were my tools against a man who had turned death into an aesthetic discipline.

"Where's the key?" I demanded, peeking just an eye from the edge of my refuge.

He smiled. It was a sad, disappointed grimace.

"You still don't understand. It's not about opening doors, but about closing your eyes."

His gloved hand moved towards the electrical panel. It wasn't a quick movement, but deliberate, giving me time to understand what was about to happen, allowing me to savor my helplessness.

"No..." I whispered.

He pulled the lever.

The distant generator's hum died instantly. The work lights hanging from the ceiling sputtered one last time and went out.

Darkness didn't fall; it lunged.

It was an absolute, solid blackness that swallowed my hands, the weapon, the ground, and my very existence. It was a blindness so total that my eyes ached from dilating uselessly, searching for a photon, a flicker, anything. The silence that followed was sepulchral, broken only by the rhythmic dripping of water, which now sounded like a clock counting down the time I had left to live.

I backed away, my spine pressed against the cold column. Panic, that creature I had kept at bay with analysis and logic, scratched at the door of my mind. I was blind, wounded, and completely lost in his labyrinth.

Then, I heard the sound.

A mechanical *click*, followed by a faint, high-pitched hum, almost imperceptible, like an electrical insect.

*Nzzzzzzzzzt.*

The sound came from where he had been. Military technology. Night vision goggles. I had seen it in inventories, in manuals, but I had never felt the weight of its implication until now.

For me, the world had ceased to exist. For him, I had just lit up in phosphorescent green, bright and vulnerable, a radiant prey in the middle of nowhere.

I heard the scuff of a rubber sole on the stone. He was approaching. And I didn't know where to aim.

## Author Style Guide

### Javier Castillo

### The Master of Contemporary Psychological Thrillers

Javier Castillo has revolutionized the Spanish suspense landscape with a formula that combines the dizzying pace of American bestsellers with emotional depth and a fragmented puzzle structure. This guide details the pillars of his style.

#### 1. Narrative Architecture: The Temporal Puzzle

Castillo's most recognizable characteristic is the rupture of linearity. His stories are not told from beginning to end but are assembled.

##### A. Multilayered Structure

*   **Intertwined Timelines:** The plot usually divides into at least two or three timeframes (e.g., the distant past of trauma, the recent past of disappearance, and the present of the investigation).
*   **Precise Headings:** Each chapter obligatorily begins with a location and a date.
    *   **Example:** New York, 1998 / Mississippi, 2020.
*   **Puzzle Effect:** Information is dispensed in such a way that a revelation in the past explains strange behavior in the present, keeping the reader in a constant state of "reconstruction."

##### B. Rhythm and the Cliffhanger

*   **Brief Chapters:** Facilitate fast, compulsive reading ("just one more page").
*   **Cliffhanger Endings:** Practically all chapters end with an impactful sentence, an unanswered question, or a revelation that changes the perception of what came before.

#### 2. Tone and Atmosphere

Castillo constructs an atmosphere of melancholic tension. It's not just suspense; it's the weight of accumulated pain.

*   **Textual Cinematography:** Descriptions are conceived as camera shots. The focus is on what the character sees and physically feels (the cold, the racing pulse, the dim light).
*   **Aesthetic Americanization:** Setting his works in the U.S. (especially the East Coast or the deep South) allows him to use archetypes of the classic thriller (the FBI, major newspapers, towns with secrets) that are familiar and universal.
*   **Emotional Darkness:** The environment often reflects the internal state of the characters: rain, basements, dense forests, or empty rooms that emphasize solitude.

#### 3. Language and Stylistic Devices

His prose is direct but sprinkled with very potent and visceral lyrical images.

##### A. Sensory and Abstract Metaphors

Castillo has a unique way of describing feelings. He avoids clichés and seeks physical images for pain or fear.

*   **Device:** Comparing an emotion to a sharp object or a destructive natural phenomenon.
    *   **Example:** "Guilt was a hungry animal nibbling at my nerve endings every time I closed my eyes."

##### B. Diction and Recurring Vocabulary

He uses words that evoke fragility and mystery:

*   Pieces, glass, broken, abyss, darkness, heartbeat, destiny, chance, truth, lie.

##### C. Introspective First Person

He usually gives voice to the protagonist through a very intimate first person. This allows for:

*   **Unreliable Narrator:** The reader only knows what the character remembers or wants to tell.
*   **Emotional Immersion:** Feeling the character's confusion and anxiety as one's own.

#### 4. Character Construction: "Broken People"

In Castillo's universe, no one is "fine." Everyone carries an emotional backpack.

*   **Trauma as a Driving Force:** The central conflict always arises from an unhealed wound from the past.
*   **Professions of Truth:** His protagonists are often journalists (like Miren Triggs), writers, or investigators. People whose social function is to ask questions, which justifies the search for clues.
*   **Moral Duality:** He explores the boundary between good and evil. His "heroes" often commit morally questionable acts to achieve an end.

#### 5. Central Themes

To write with Castillo's hallmark, the plot must pivot on these axes:

*   **Disappearance:** The void left by someone who vanishes without a trace.
*   **Destiny vs. Chance:** The idea that an insignificant decision can destroy an entire life years later.
*   **Family Secrets:** The family as a place of love, but also as the repository of the darkest lies.
*   **Identity:** People who discover they are not who they thought they were.

### Castillo Style Checklist

[ ] Have I started the chapter with a Date and Place?

[ ] Have I ended the chapter with a shocking twist or revelation?

[ ] Are there at least two intersecting timelines?

[ ] Have I used a visceral metaphor to describe fear or sadness?

[ ] Is my protagonist a person "marked" by a past event?

[ ] Is the pace fast enough to keep the reader from stopping?

## Chapter 34: Fuego Frío

The mist of breath froze before touching the ground. It was not a natural cave, but an inverted cathedral carved into the glacier's entrails, where stalactites hung like the fangs of a sleeping beast. The hum of diesel generators, a constant, mechanical heartbeat, desecrated the mountain's millennia-old silence.

Elena Vives stopped dead in her tracks, her boots embedded in the bare rock. Her left hand instinctively sought the cold face of her father's watch on her wrist, a nervous tic that not even therapy had managed to eradicate. Before her, illuminated by surgical spotlights that cast long, violent shadows, rose the cylinders.

There were six of them. Transparent polymer columns filled with a viscous liquid, in which those Aigüestortes had given up for lost floated suspended. They weren't dead, or at least they didn't appear to be; the 'preservation' the psychological profile spoke of was there, manifested in an obscene stillness. Static beauty, free from the decay of time.

“Cold is the only absolute truth, Elena,” the voice echoed from the gloom, bouncing off the bluish ice walls. “It stops entropy. It stops pain.”

The smell came first. A chemical slap of antiseptic mixed with the artificial sweetness of mint. The aroma of Dr. Arnald Soler.

Lucas Riera emerged to her right, his service pistol trembling slightly in his calloused hands. The limp in his right leg was more pronounced than ever; the damp cold of the cavern must have been gnawing at his joints like a rabid dog.

“Hands where I can see them!” Lucas shouted. His voice cracked, devoid of its usual authority, eroded by the horror of seeing familiar faces behind the glass.

Arnald stepped out from behind the last cylinder. He wasn't wearing a lab coat, but an immaculate gray thermal suit and blue nitrile gloves that looked like a corpse's hands. His eyes, shards of ice identical to the environment, showed no fear of the weapon. Only paternal disappointment.

“Lucas, always so predictable,” the doctor whispered, adjusting his gloves. “The disease is eating you from the inside, boy. I can see it in your posture. I could stop it, you know? I could stop it all right now.”

“Shut up!” Lucas took a step forward, but his bad knee gave way under the weight of the tension.

A dry crack echoed in the grotto. It wasn't a gunshot, but the sound of Lucas's boot slipping on an invisible patch of black ice. The police chief fell heavily onto his side, and the weapon slid across the polished stone floor, away into the darkness.

Arnald didn't run. He moved with the fluidity of one who knows every crevice of his sanctuary. In his right hand, surgical steel glinted: a long-bladed scalpel.

Elena felt the world narrow. Emotional claustrophobia, that old friend that constricted her throat, threatened to paralyze her. *Don't analyze*, she ordered herself. *Act*. Her green eyes scanned the space, searching for an advantage. Cylinders, cables, metal tables with instruments... and her own backpack, fallen two meters away.

The doctor lunged at Lucas, who was fruitlessly trying to get up. Arnald wasn't seeking to kill with fury, but with precision; he raised the scalpel, aiming for the femoral artery, a clean cut to bleed the officer dry in minutes.

“No!” The scream tore from Elena's throat.

She lunged for her backpack, ignoring the sharp pain as her knees slammed against the rock. Her fingers, numb from the sub-zero temperature, torpedoed into the fabric's interior. *Rope, ice axe... no time...* Her hand closed around a cold, rough metal cylinder. The emergency flare.

She heard a grunt from Lucas and the wet sound of tearing fabric. Arnald was on top of him.

Elena ripped off the safety cap with her teeth, tasting metal on her tongue, and pulled the firing pin.

A furious hiss filled the cave.

The red light exploded with the violence of a dying sun. The magnesium burned at a thousand degrees, devouring oxygen and staining the blue ice an infernal crimson. Shadows danced wildly, turning the stalactites into bloodied claws.

Elena didn't throw the flare. She brandished it like a sword of fire, charging at Arnald.

The doctor looked up, and for the first time, his mask of control shattered. His pupils, dilated by the perpetual gloom of the cave, couldn't adapt. The glare blinded him instantly. He dropped the scalpel and brought his hands to his face with a shriek that sounded not human, but animal.

“My eyes! I can't see the work!”

Elena seized the confusion. With a movement born of the most primitive desperation, she rammed Arnald with her shoulder, keeping him away from Lucas. The impact sent the doctor stumbling backward, away from the safe zone of the platform.

Arnald stumbled, disoriented by the white blindness burning his retinas. His feet sought purchase, but found only the uneven edge of a slope of compacted snow that descended towards the lower natural ventilation tunnels.

“Elena!” Lucas warned from the ground, pressing his hand against the superficial cut on his thigh.

The doctor faltered one last time. His heel stepped into emptiness. There was no dramatic fall into a chemical pit, no definitive end. His body rolled down the hard snow slope, disappearing into the blackness of a side tunnel, swallowed by the entrails of the mountain he believed he controlled. The thuds of his body against the ice walls faded, replaced by the echo of his distant curses.

The heat from the flare, still crackling in Elena's hand, had done more than just blind the enemy. The brutal thermal shift, fire against the ancient icy mass, triggered a chain reaction in the unstable vault.

*Crrrreeeacck.*

The sound was geological. A spiderweb crack appeared in the ceiling, directly above the preservation tanks. A block of ice the size of a car broke off, crashing to the ground just meters from where Lucas lay.

The ground vibrated. The cave, violated by heat and violence, began to reject its invaders.

Elena threw the flare, which continued to burn on the rock, and ran to Lucas. She grabbed him by the armpits, pulling him with a strength she didn't know she possessed.

“Get up! We have to go!” she cried, her voice barely audible over the roar of fracturing ice.

Lucas gritted his teeth, cold sweat mixing with the blood on his leg. He leaned on her, using her as a human crutch.

“He got away…” he gasped, looking toward the dark tunnel where Arnald had disappeared.

“If we stay, we'll become part of his collection,” she retorted, pushing him toward the exit, toward the main tunnel they had entered.

Behind them, the Sculptor's sanctuary began to collapse. The ice was reclaiming its own, burying the cylinders, the evidence, and the secrets under tons of solid water. But Arnald Soler was not among the rubble. The monster had fled into the storm, wounded, blind, but alive. And the mountain, outside, roared with the promise of an endless night.

## Chapter 35: El Derrumbe

THE SCULPTOR'S CAVE, VALL DE BOÍ
DECEMBER 26, 2018

The silence that followed the Sculptor's fall was not one of peace, but of inhalation. The mountain, wounded by the detonations and the unnatural violence it had harbored in its bowels, took a breath an instant before roaring.

Elena Vives felt the vibration in the soles of her boots before she heard the sound. It was not a deep geological tremor, but something more fragile and terrifying: the structure of ice and rock, weakened by years of maniacal excavations and the recent heat of the flare, was yielding to gravity. The gallery ceiling, that vault which had been a cathedral of horrors, let out a sharp groan, similar to metal twisting under hydraulic pressure.

“Move,” she ordered herself, though her voice failed her. It was a mental command, an electrical impulse sent to legs that felt filled with molten lead.

Lucas's pistol weighed in her right hand like an anchor, but her fingers refused to release it. The instinct to cling to the only tool of power she had left was superior to the logic of survival.

A block of schist the size of a coffin detached from the ceiling and crashed three meters from her, pulverizing one of the empty display cases. The roar was physical, a slap of air and dust that filled her mouth with the coppery taste of old earth. Elena spun on her heels, turning her back on the abyss where her executioner lay, and ran.

It wasn't an athletic run, like those she practiced on the trails of Aigüestortes to quiet the noise in her mind. It was a clumsy, animalistic flight. Her boots slipped on the uneven ground, covered in frost and debris. Her breath scraped her throat, each inhalation a mix of stale air and limestone particles.

She reached the bifurcation that led to the main exit, the wide tunnel through which they had entered.

She stopped dead, skidding on the gravel.

Before her eyes, the architecture of the cave changed in real time. A zigzagging crack, like a black lightning bolt drawn on the stone, ran across the tunnel's lintel. With a dry, painful crunch, tons of rock collapsed, sealing the passage with absolute finality. The resulting cloud of dust struck her, forcing her to cover her face with her forearm, protecting her moss-green eyes from the sandy blindness.

She coughed, bending at the waist. Panic, that old shadow that had lived in her chest since the failed case, tried to close its claws around her lungs. *Claustrophobia*. The idea of being buried alive, of becoming yet another fossil in the mountain's collection, threatened to paralyze her.

*Analyze. Don't feel, analyze.*

She forced herself to look at her father's watch on her left wrist. The second hand advanced with mechanical indifference. Time existed. She existed.

The main gallery was blocked. The ceiling above her groaned, releasing a fine rain of pebbles that clattered against her shoulders like hail. She needed another way out. Elena's mind, trained to see patterns where others only saw chaos, scanned the gloom.

The air.

If the cave collapsed, the displaced air had to escape somewhere. Or, even better, if the storm outside roared with the force she remembered, the pressure difference must be creating a current.

She closed her eyes for a second, blocking out the visual terror to enhance her sense of touch.

There it was. An icy caress on her right cheek. A tongue of frozen air that did not belong to the stagnant atmosphere of the underground.

She turned towards the side wall. At first glance, it appeared to be a solid wall of sedimentary rock, but as she approached, the residual light allowed her to distinguish a vertical fissure, hidden behind a broken stalagmite. It wasn't a tunnel, barely a scar in the rock, probably a natural drainage channel for spring meltwater.

The air whistled through it.

Elena shed the imaginary backpack of fear and assessed the opening. It was narrow. Terribly narrow. Her slender build was her only advantage, but even so, it would be like returning to the earth's womb.

The ground beneath her feet shook violently. Behind her, in the gallery of horrors, the ceiling began to collapse in a chain reaction. The roar became a continuous rumble, an avalanche of stone devouring the empty space, drawing closer to her position.

There was no choice.

She tucked the pistol into her waistband, feeling the cold metal against her hip, and squeezed into the fissure.

The world narrowed to friction. The rock pressed against her chest and back simultaneously. She moved sideways, crawling like a worm. The rock tore at her technical jacket, scratching the skin underneath. Every centimeter gained was a negotiation with the mountain.

Her breathing quickened, short and shallow. The space was so narrow that she couldn't fully expand her rib cage. The darkness was absolute now, thick as tar. Only the sound of destruction behind her and the howl of the wind ahead gave her spatial coordinates.

*I'm going to die trapped here. The rock will shift and crush my ribs.*

The voice in her head was seductive, inviting her to surrender.

“Shut up,” she growled, and the word was lost, absorbed by the stone.

She followed the air current. The cold intensified, transforming from an annoyance to a sharp pain that bit at her face. Her gloved, clumsy hands searched for handholds on the uneven surface. A sharp edge cut her cheek, but the pain was irrelevant.

Suddenly, the incline sloped upwards. Elena jammed her boots into the walls, using them as wedges, and climbed. Her muscles burned, lactic acid flooding her limbs, but adrenaline was a powerful fuel.

She saw a diffuse clarity above. Not sunlight, not even moonlight, but the milky gray of nocturnal snow reflecting nothingness.

With one last effort, driven by the primal terror of what was happening below, she hoisted herself up. Her hands found powdery snow, soft and treacherous, and then firm rock covered in ice. She pulled herself up, feeling her hips get momentarily stuck before breaking free with a yank that nearly dislocated her shoulder.

Elena rolled onto the surface, moving away from the opening.

The outside air hit her like a sledgehammer. It wasn't simply cold; it was atmospheric violence. The blizzard howled with a fury that made the cave's collapse seem like child's play. The snow fell horizontally, white needles stabbing into every exposed millimeter of skin.

She had barely moved three meters away when the earth beneath the snow shuddered.

A dull, deep sound, like a drum beaten underwater, rumbled through the valley. Elena turned, covering her face with her hands.

Where the fissure from which she had just escaped had been, the ground sank. The mountainside seemed to sigh and then imploded. Snow, rock, and ice were swallowed by the earth in a cloud of white dust that merged with the storm. The secret entrance, the gallery of display cases, the Sculptor's body... everything vanished, sealed beneath tons of eternal debris.

The mountain had closed its scar.

Elena lay in the snow, panting, her heart pounding against the frozen ground. The cold immediately began to penetrate her layers of clothing, reminding her that the escape wasn't over. It had only changed scenery.

She looked out into the white nothingness surrounding her. She was out, yes. But she was alone, in the middle of the worst storm of the century, and the night had no intention of being merciful.

She touched her pocket, verifying that the weapon was still there, a talisman of steel. Then she looked at her watch. The face was cracked, but the hands were still moving.

She had to find Lucas.

## Chapter 36: Capítulo 36

**Slopes of Peguera Peak, Aigüestortes**
**December 26, 2018**

The silence after the catastrophe weighed more than the rock itself.

Elena Vives emerged from the snow like someone reborn, but without the innocence of birth; only with the grime and guilt clinging to her skin. The roar that had swallowed the cave entrance, burying the Sculptor and his gallery of horrors under tons of granite, had ceased. Instead, the wind howled, claiming the acoustic void with a ferocity that chilled the blood even before it touched the skin.

She rose, coughing stone dust and ice crystals. The world had shrunk to a scale of violent grays. The storm, that white beast christened with technical names by meteorologists and feared by locals as an ancient deity, had swallowed the mountain. There was no up or down, only a vortex of icy needles piercing her exposed cheeks.

She looked at her hands. In her right, she still clutched Lucas's service pistol. The metal bit into her palm, a frigid reminder of the violence she had just enacted. She felt no remorse for the man crushed in the earth's bowels; her analytical mind, the one that usually dissected criminal profiles with surgical precision, now only processed basic survival data.

“Lucas?” The word emerged from her throat like a shard of glass, tearing at her vocal cords.

The blizzard carried the name away, scattering it into the vast blackness.

Elena forced herself to her feet. Her legs, numb from the forced position and the cold, reacted with sharp cramps and deep pain. Her technical high-mountain gear, torn during the escape and collapse, no longer retained body heat. She felt the temperature stealing the sensation from her toes, a slow, narcotic invasion promising a sleep from which she wouldn't awaken.

She spun around, searching for landmarks. The mine entrance had vanished. Where a black hole had once gaped in the hillside, there was now only a slope of rubble and disturbed snow, a fresh scar on the face of Peguera. Lucas had stayed outside, protecting the perimeter, battling his own limp and exhaustion. He had to be nearby.

“Lucas!” she shouted again, this time injecting all the air her aching lungs could muster.

She took a step and sank knee-deep. The fresh snow concealed the terrain's traps: loose rocks, crevices, treacherous roots. Every movement was a negotiation with gravity. Her father's watch, its face cracked by some recent impact, marked an irrelevant time. Seconds didn't matter; only heartbeats. And hers galloped wildly against her ribs, searching for an escape.

She advanced blindly, guided only by the spatial memory of where he had been before the world came crashing down. Visibility was nil. She extended her left arm, groping at the void, while with her right, she kept the weapon pressed to her chest, a useless talisman against the elements.

She stumbled. She fell face down, and the metallic taste of blood filled her mouth as she bit her tongue. She wanted to stay there. The snow suddenly seemed comfortable, a soft bed offering rest. “Just a moment,” a seductive voice whispered at the base of her skull. “Close your eyes. Stop fighting.”

The image of Lucas’s brown eyes, with that tired gaze that always seemed to understand too much, flashed in her mind. It wasn't a hallucination; it was an anchor. He hadn't given up on her when she was a hostile stranger invading his precinct. She couldn't leave him to die alone in that vast blackness.

She got to her feet with an animalistic growl. Determination replaced warmth.

About 10 meters ahead, a dark shape broke the monotony of the white. It didn't have the hard edges of a rock or the verticality of a pine. It was an irregular lump, half-covered by the mantle the storm wove with industrial speed.

Elena lunged towards it, ignoring the stab of pain in her quadriceps. She dropped to her knees beside the shape and began digging with her bare hands, frantic. She pushed the snow aside as if it were grave dirt.

The synthetic fabric of a parka appeared beneath her fingers. Navy blue. The local police uniform.

“Lucas, please, no…” she pleaded, her voice broken by the tears she couldn't allow herself to shed.

She pulled at the body, turning it with an effort that wrenched a groan from her. Lucas Riera’s face was pale, with a bluish tinge to his lips that made Elena’s stomach clench into a tight knot. His eyes were closed, and a deep cut on his forehead, above his left eyebrow, had a black, glistening crust of frozen blood.

Elena pulled off her right glove with her teeth and pressed her fingers against his neck, searching for the carotid artery. Her own hands trembled so much that at first, she felt nothing. Panic, a black, viscous tide, threatened to drown her.

“Focus. Search for life.”

There it was. Weak. Erratic. Like the flutter of a moth trapped in a jar. But it was there.

“You’re alive,” she whispered, and the vapor of her breath struck the inert face of the officer. “You hear me, Riera. Don’t you dare leave me here alone! I haven’t given you permission!”

Lucas didn’t respond. His breathing was shallow, barely a whistle between his parted lips. Hypothermia was already doing its work, extinguishing vital systems one by one, like someone turning off the lights in an empty house.

Elena assessed the situation with terrifying clarity. They were exposed to the elements, in the midst of the decade’s worst cyclogenesis, without shelter, without communication, and with one of the two incapacitated. The valley was isolated. No one was coming. Hope wasn't a strategy; it was a luxury they couldn't afford.

She looked around, searching for natural shelter, a ledge, anything. Nothing. Only the night and the snow that fell with the intent of erasing them from the map. She had to move him. She had to find warmth. Or they would both die before dawn.

She grabbed Lucas by his jacket lapels and pulled. He weighed a ton of inert flesh and wet clothes. Elena gritted her teeth until her jaw ached.

“Come on,” she growled, dragging him inch by inch up the slope. “Come on, damn it!”

That’s when she saw it. About 10 meters away, half-hidden by a boulder that had deflected part of the avalanche, something glowed with a faint, artificial light. It wasn't the reflection of the moon, which was non-existent that night. It was a red indicator light. Flashing.

A snowmobile.

Probably the vehicle the Sculptor had used to get there, or perhaps a forgotten emergency cache. The origin didn’t matter; the promise did.

Elena felt a surge of pure adrenaline. It was the difference between the end and opportunity. She pulled Lucas again, her boots slipping, her muscles burning with the fire of supreme effort.

They reached the machine. It was semi-overturned, but the engine still radiated residual heat. Elena checked the panel. It had fuel.

She hoisted Lucas onto the back with a strength she didn't know she possessed, securing him with the safety straps meant for cargo. He groaned faintly, a sound of pain that was music to her ears. It meant he still felt.

She climbed into the driver’s seat. Her hands, stiff as claws, fumbled for the ignition. She turned the key. The engine coughed, sputtered, and died.

“Don’t do this to me,” Elena hissed, pounding the handlebars. “Work! You have to work!”

She tried again. The engine’s roar sprang to life, rough and noisy, competing with the storm. The headlight flickered on, cutting through the profound darkness with a beam of yellow light that illuminated a suicidal downhill path.

Elena looked back, towards the pile of rocks that buried the cave. Evil was sealed in there. But the mountain wasn't done with them yet.

She accelerated, and the snowmobile launched itself into the white abyss, descending towards the valley where shadows awaited, and where the truth, like ice, was beginning to crack.

## Chapter 37: Capítulo 37

**Western slope of Peguera Peak, December 26, 2018**

The roar of the engine was the only constant in a universe that had turned white and hostile. Elena Vives gripped the snowmobile's handlebars with such force that her knuckles had turned the color of old wax, visually merging with the tempest devouring the world. There was no up or down, only the frantic advance through a milky void and the dead weight of Lucas Riera against her back, tied to her waist with a climbing rope she had salvaged from the emergency kit.

The machine's vibration climbed her arms, shaking the crescent-shaped scar on her left palm, a pulsating reminder of past mistakes that now served as an anchor to keep her from losing her sanity.

The wind wasn't blowing; it was pushing with the solidity of an invisible concrete wall. The snow wasn't falling; it was shooting horizontally, thousands of microscopic needles seeking any exposed inch of skin to plunge in their icy venom. Elena squinted her moss-green eyes, barely protected by scratched snow goggles she had found in the cargo compartment. Each jolt from the uneven terrain sent an electric shock up her spine, but the real terror wasn't capsizing, but the stillness she felt behind her.

Lucas wasn't moving. His head rested heavily on her right shoulder, an inert burden that threatened to drag them both into oblivion.

“Hang on!” she yelled, though the sound was torn from her lips before she could hear it, swallowed by the storm's bellowing throat.

The descent was a calculated suicide. Without visual references, Elena navigated, trusting gravity and a primitive instinct that screamed at her that the valley was below. Peguera Peak's slope was a labyrinth of sharp rocks hidden beneath the pristine blanket, deadly traps waiting to shatter the vehicle's skis.

A sudden lurch almost unseated her. The rear track skidded on black ice. The vehicle fishtailed, roaring in protest. Elena compensated with her body weight, leaning to the left, feeling Lucas's inert torso pendulum dangerously. Fear, that viscous entity that usually paralyzed her in enclosed spaces, here expanded to fill the horizon. There were no walls, but the claustrophobia was absolute; the sky had collapsed onto their heads.

She looked at her father's watch on her wrist. The hands glowed faintly in the daytime gloom. Twenty minutes had passed since the mountain swallowed the Sculptor. Twenty minutes in which Lucas's body temperature must have dropped to levels incompatible with life.

Suddenly, a rectangular shadow emerged from the whiteness, solid and geometric amidst the organic chaos.

A stone hut. A dry-stone construction, a vestige of ancient shepherds, crouching against a rock overhang that protected it from avalanches.

Elena released the accelerator. The snowmobile slowed, sinking into the accumulated powder snow. She stopped the engine a few meters from the entrance. The silence that followed was more deafening than the mechanical roar; an auditory void that hummed in her ears.

She unfastened the knot at her waist with clumsy, numb fingers that seemed to belong to a corpse. Turning, she saw Lucas's face. Frost had covered his eyelashes and the gray hairs at his temples, giving him the appearance of an abandoned marble statue. The blood from the wound on his head had solidified into a dark, almost black, maroon trail.

“Lucas,” she whispered.

Nothing. Not a twitch.

She dismounted the vehicle, sinking knee-deep. The wind exploited her vulnerability to buffet her, almost knocking her down. She walked towards the wooden door, worm-eaten by decades of winters, and pulled on the rusty iron latch. It was stuck.

Desperation transformed into mechanical fury. Elena picked up a stone from the ground, a granite shard with sharp edges, and struck the metal. Once, twice, three times. The sound of the impact was dry, pathetic against the storm's majesty. On the fourth strike, the rust yielded.

Now came the impossible part.

She returned to the snowmobile. Lucas was a large man, broad-shouldered and with dense bones. She, with her athletic but slender build, was an ant trying to move a fallen giant. She grabbed him under the armpits, feeling the stiffness of the police parka beneath her gloves.

“Help me, damn it,” she growled, pulling with her back muscles, using her legs as a lever.

The body slid from the seat and fell onto the snow with a dull thud that pained her soul. She dragged him. Every meter was a battle won against entropy. Her boots slipped, her breath was a torn bellows, vaporizing before her eyes. Lucas's weight was the weight of all the guilt she carried: the victim she hadn't saved in the past, the lie of her retirement, the attraction she never dared confess to him.

They reached the threshold. With one last inhuman effort, a tug that made her see stars and strained every fiber of her neck, she pulled him into the gloom of the shelter.

She kicked the door shut and dropped the crossbar.

The interior darkness smelled of old firewood, dust, and rodent droppings. But there was no wind. The outdoor howl reduced to a distant wail.

Elena didn't allow herself to rest. Her hands flew over his body. She sought the carotid pulse. Her fingers, still numb, pressed against his cold neck.

One second. Two.

There it was. A weak, erratic beat, like the flutter of a dying bird trapped in a too-large ribcage.

“You're here,” she exhaled, and the accumulated tension broke into a dry, tearless sob.

The place was austere. A stone fireplace in one corner, a rotten wooden cot, and a wobbly table. Elena pulled a tactical flashlight from Lucas's pocket and swept the room with its beam. There were remnants of firewood piled next to the hearth. Dry. Miraculous.

She worked with the efficiency of an automaton. She tore pieces of her own thermal shirt to use as tinder. She took Lucas's lighter from his pants pocket. The small flame danced, fragile, before igniting the fabric and licking the wood. Smoke began to rise, and with it, a promise of warmth.

She returned to the officer. She needed to see the wound. With surgical care, she parted his matted black hair. The blow was ugly, an irregular gash on his parietal bone, but the clotted blood had stopped the bleeding. The real enemy wasn't the cranial trauma, but hypothermia.

She had to remove his wet clothes. The parka was stiff with ice. Elena struggled with the zipper, cursing the manufacturer, the weather, and fate. When she finally managed to open it, she removed his vest, flannel shirt, and inner t-shirt soaked with cold sweat.

Lucas's skin had a bluish tint under the light of the nascent fire. The old scars and calluses on his hands told the story of a man who had lived to protect others, forgetting himself.

Elena shed her own jacket and lay down beside him on the stone floor, ignoring the dirt. There weren't enough blankets, no medicine. She only had her own body heat. She pressed against his back, wrapping her arms around his broad chest, intertwining her legs with his.

It was an intimacy forced by survival, but one that detonated something deep within her psyche. She felt the slowness of his breathing against her own chest.

“Don't you dare leave me alone in this, Riera,” she whispered against the back of his neck.

The fire crackled, casting dancing shadows on the bare stone walls. Elena looked at her watch. The face was cracked, a diagonal line splitting time in two: before and after the shelter.

Suddenly, Lucas moved. It was barely a spasm, an involuntary muscle contraction.

“Elena?” The name came from his throat like the sound of sandpaper scraping stone.

She sat up slightly, propping herself on an elbow to look at his face. Lucas's brown eyes were half-open, glazed, unfocused, searching for something in the gloom that wasn't there.

“I'm here. We're safe,” she lied. No one was safe while the White Beast roared outside.

Lucas blinked slowly, fighting a narcotic fog. His large, cold hand sought hers, finding the scar on her palm. His fingers closed weakly around Elena's hand.

“I saw him...” he murmured, his voice thick and slurred. “Before the roof fell in...”

Elena felt a chill that had nothing to do with the temperature.

“Who did you see, Lucas? The Sculptor is dead.”

Lucas shook his head, an infinitesimal movement that seemed to cost him all his remaining energy. His gaze cleared for a second, lucid and terrified, fixing on her green eyes.

“Not the Sculptor...” he coughed, and a bubble of pink blood appeared on his lips. “I saw the satellite phone in his hand. The light was on, Elena.”

He paused to draw breath, a sibilant, painful sound.

“He wasn't calling for help... he was confirming the dispatch.”

The phrase hung in the stale air of the hut. Elena felt her blood run cold in her veins. If the Sculptor had sent something before dying—coordinates, files, an order—then his death wasn't the end. It was just the first movement of a mechanism that had just been set in motion.

The fire crackled, oblivious to the new abyss opening beneath their feet. They were isolated, wounded, and trapped by the storm of the century, but what truly ought to terrify them wasn't outside, in the snow, but traveling invisibly through data networks to an unknown recipient.

## Chapter 38: Capítulo 38

The cold was not a guest; it had become the absolute master of the cabin. It didn't bite, but gnawed, a slow, constant erosion that stripped the rotting wood of any illusion of refuge. Elena Vives felt her own body temperature plummeting, a biological countdown marked not by seconds, but by shivers.

They were huddled in the furthest corner from the door, on a musty straw mattress that smelled of ancient damp and forgotten sheep's wool. Elena kept her back against the stone wall, using her torso as a shield for Lucas Riera. The police chief lay with his head in her lap, his large, calloused hands inert on his chest, seeking a warmth the atmosphere denied him.

"Don't fall asleep," Elena whispered. Her voice emerged like a wisp of vapor, hoarse, scratching a parched throat.

Lucas blinked. His usually warm brown eyes were glazed, sunken in dark sockets. Hypothermia wasn't violent at this stage; it was a narcotic seduction, a promise of peace if one only closed their eyelids.

"I can't feel my leg," he murmured. The grimace of pain that had contorted his face for the past hour had softened, and that was what terrified Elena. Pain was life; its absence, the prelude to the end.

She slid her left hand under his jacket, searching for his heartbeat. The crescent-shaped scar on her palm brushed against the rough fabric of his uniform. Lucas's heart beat with the slowness of a funeral drum. *Thump... silence... thump.*

"Talk to me, Riera." Elena shook the man's shoulder, forcing an authoritative tone she didn't feel. Fear, that old shadow that had haunted her since her retirement, tried to close its claw around her lungs. Emotional claustrophobia. There, trapped by the storm of the century, there was no escape. "Tell me something real. No police procedures."

Lucas managed a half-smile, lopsided and weak.

"My grandmother... she used to say that snow has memory. That if you die in it... it keeps you forever."

"No one is going to die today." The assertion was sharp, but lacked foundation.

The wind howled outside, a bodiless beast scratching at the board joints, seeking entry. The 'White Beast' had not only isolated the valley; it was erasing it from the map. Elena looked towards the door, barricaded with a worm-eaten beam. The darkness was almost total, only broken by the grayish bioluminescence filtering through the cracks, a reflection of the snow piled against the walls.

Elena felt a cramp in her legs. She needed to move to generate warmth, but if she moved away from Lucas, he would lose the only thermal source keeping him tethered to consciousness. She settled for rubbing the policeman's arms, a frantic and useless friction against the frozen immensity.

Suddenly, the sound of the wind changed.

It wasn't a howl, but a dull thud. Something heavy had collided with the outer structure.

Elena froze. Her analytical mind, trained to dissect crime scenes, instantly activated, cutting through the fog of numbness. The sound was unnatural. It wasn't a branch broken by the gale. It was rhythmic.

*Crack. Crack. Crack.*

Footsteps. Someone was breaking the crust of ice accumulated in front of the entrance.

Lucas tried to sit up, but his muscles didn't respond. He only managed a choked moan.

"Elena?"

"Silence," she hissed.

She fumbled in the gloom. Her fingers closed around an old, rusty iron poker they had found next to the blind fireplace. The metal was so cold it burned her skin.

The blows ceased. The silence that followed was heavier than the storm. Elena held her breath, her moss-green eyes fixed on the door, trying to drill through the wood with her gaze. The Sculptor? Had he come to finish his work, to cure his 'art' by freezing the witnesses?

The doorknob turned. The rust protested with an agonized creak.

The beam they used as a bar vibrated, but held.

"Open up!" The voice came muffled, barely a human thread in the cacophony of the tempest.

Elena didn't move. She squeezed the poker until her knuckles turned white. If it was the killer, he would break in by force. If it was help... what kind of help could walk through that white hell?

A brutal blow shook the entire cabin. The wood groaned. Another blow. The beam jumped from its supports, falling to the floor with a dull thud.

The door burst open, pushed by a violent gust of wind that brought with it a swirl of snow and hail. The temperature inside plummeted instantly.

A figure was silhouetted in the doorway.

It was massive, distorted by layers of technical clothing and covered in frost from head to toe. It looked like a yeti, a creature born from the storm itself. It wore blizzard goggles that hid its eyes and a thick scarf covered its face.

Elena stood up, stumbling, raising the rusty iron like a spear.

"Stay back!" she cried, though her voice cracked.

The newcomer did not retreat. He took a step inside and slammed the door shut, fighting against the air pressure until he managed to snap the latch shut. Silence returned, but now there was a new presence, charged with urgency.

The man pulled down his scarf and took off his goggles.

Icy blue eyes, framed by frozen lashes, met hers. His ash-blond hair, usually neat, was flattened by his hat and damp with cold sweat.

"Put that down, Elena," said Dr. Arnald Soler. His breath formed dense clouds in the stale air.

Elena didn't lower the weapon. Her brain processed the information with painful slowness. Arnald. Her mentor. The man who had taught her to read the minds of monsters. And the man whose alibis were starting to show too many cracks.

"How...?" she began, but the trembling of her jaw prevented her from finishing.

Arnald didn't answer immediately. He took off the heavy backpack he was carrying and dropped it with a metallic clang. His movements were precise, clinical, ignoring the threat of the poker.

"Lucas needs immediate attention," Arnald said, ignoring the question. He knelt beside the policeman, who barely seemed aware of the new presence.

Elena watched the door, expecting to see someone else enter. Perhaps Roco, Lucas's dog, who had disappeared into the woods hours ago. But the threshold remained closed. Arnald had arrived alone. Absolutely alone in the middle of nowhere.

"Where's the rescue team?" Elena asked, lowering the iron a few inches, but without letting go.

"I am it." Arnald pulled a golden thermal blanket from his backpack and began to wrap Lucas with an efficiency that bordered on the mechanical. "No one else could come up. The roads are obliterated. I had to use snowshoes and the old smugglers' route."

"On foot?" Incredulity battled with relief. "It's suicide, Arnald."

"Or a necessity." The doctor looked up. His eyes were expressionless, pools of calm amidst the disaster. "I knew you would come here. It was the only logical refuge according to the geographical profile of the area. And I knew Lucas wouldn't last the night without medication."

Arnald took out a thermos and a vial. The smell that emanated from him when he opened his parka hit Elena. It wasn't just sweat and snow. There was something else. A subtle, almost imperceptible trace of mint and... surgical soap? The clean, sterile scent, amidst the cabin's grime, was disturbingly out of place.

Elena took a step back, her back hitting the cold wall.

"How did you know we were alive?"

Arnald was busy injecting something into Lucas's arm. The policeman groaned as the needle pierced skin hardened by the cold.

"I didn't know," the doctor replied without looking back. "But the alternative was to let you die. And you know I don't like losing my cases, Elena. Or my patients."

Elena watched Arnald's hands. They were steady, without the slightest tremor despite the physical exertion of the climb. Hands that healed. Hands that could manipulate bodies with an artist's precision.

Lucas coughed, a convulsion that shook his body under the thermal blanket.

"Arnald..." croaked the policeman, finally recognizing the man. "Roco... did you see Roco?"

The doctor shook his head, adjusting the blanket's collar around Lucas's chin.

"There was nothing out there, Lucas. Only ice and wind. If the dog got separated from you..."

He left the sentence hanging in the air, suspended like a death sentence. Elena felt a pang of pain for the animal, but it was eclipsed by the tension emanating from Arnald. He had arrived too quickly. He knew the location too precisely.

"Here." Arnald handed the thermos to Elena. "Broth with electrolytes. Drink. You're entering phase two of hypothermia. Your lips are blue."

Elena hesitated. She looked at the steaming liquid. Her body screamed for it, every cell demanding warmth. But her instinct, that internal alarm that had kept her alive in the face of human predators, hummed in her ears.

"You first," she said.

Arnald paused. A shadow of emotion crossed his pale face. Disappointment? Amusement? He raised the thermos and took a long drink, maintaining eye contact with her. Then he wiped his mouth with the back of his gloved hand.

"I'm not your enemy, Elena. Your mind sees patterns where there is only chaos. It's your gift and your curse." He extended the thermos to her again. "Drink. If you faint, I won't be able to carry both of you."

Elena took the container. The heat of the metal transferred to her numb fingers, a sensation so intense it almost hurt. She drank. The salty, hot liquid went down her throat like lava, awakening her constricted stomach.

"The storm will last at least forty-eight more hours," Arnald informed her, returning to massaging Lucas's bad leg to reactivate circulation. "We're trapped."

Elena slid down the wall until she was sitting, the poker still within reach.

"Trapped," she repeated.

The cabin, which had previously seemed like a solitary tomb, had transformed. Now it was a shared cage. Lucas dozed under the effect of the medicine and the warmth. And she was locked in with Arnald Soler, her mentor, her savior, and perhaps, just perhaps, the monster who froze people to preserve them eternally.

Arnald took off his parka, revealing an immaculate gray wool sweater underneath. He sat opposite them, crossing his legs, and pulled out a small camping lantern that illuminated the shelter with a white, clinical, unforgiving light.

"Rest, Elena," he said, his voice soft, almost hypnotic. "I'll take the first watch."

Elena gritted her teeth. Her eyelids weighed tons. The warmth of the broth was betraying her, pushing her towards sleep. But she knew one thing with absolute certainty: she would not close her eyes. Not while Arnald Soler was watching them with that icy gaze, evaluating their fragility as if they were unfinished sculptures.

Outside, the storm roared again, burying any hope of escape under meters of white silence.

## Chapter 39: Capítulo 39

The wind did not howl; it shrieked with the voice of a thousand torn throats. Outside the stone walls of the Ventosa i Calvell shelter, the storm known as “The White Beast” had ceased to be a meteorological phenomenon, transforming into an entity with a will of its own, a ravenous deity clawing at the wood, seeking any crevice to devour the warmth that still lingered inside.

Elena Vives adjusted her father’s watch on her wrist, a reflexive gesture, a nervous tic that sought to anchor her to a time that seemed to have dissolved. The hands glowed faintly in the gloom, indifferent to the chaos that reigned in the valley. Inside the cabin, the air was thick, laden with the smell of dampness, old wool, and the metallic tang of dried blood.

Lucas Riera lay on a straw mattress in the corner most sheltered from the drafts. His breathing was a wet, rhythmic, painful death rattle, competing with the roar outside. Elena approached him, her boots thudding dully against the floorboards. She knelt, ignoring the sharp pain in her own joints, remnants of the hellish trek that had brought them there.

“Lucas,” she whispered, though she knew the name would be lost in the gale’s roar.

The police chief's skin was the color of damp ash. Sweat beaded his forehead despite the cold that numbed Elena's fingers. It wasn't just the physical wound consuming him; it was the degenerative disease he had concealed so carefully, and which now, under the extreme pressure of exhaustion and hypothermia, was exacting its toll.

Elena placed the back of her hand on his forehead. It burned. A raging fever that contrasted with the frozen world trying to kill them.

“Hold on,” she ordered, transforming the plea into a military command. She couldn't afford the weakness of compassion, not now. She needed him to be a pillar, even if cracked.

She stood and walked to the small, barred window. Through the slats of the shutters, the daylight was a milky gray, indistinguishable from night. The snow wasn't falling; it flew horizontally, like glass shrapnel. The “claustrophobia of the soul” that always stalked her began to close its fingers around her throat. It wasn't the small space that terrified her, but the lack of control, the certainty that nature had decided to erase all traces of human order.

Suddenly, a different sound broke the storm's monotony.

It wasn't the creaking of yielding wood, nor the whistling of the wind. It was a dry knock. Rhythmic. Human.

*Knock. Knock. Knock.*

Elena froze. Her heart, which until that moment had beaten with the lethargy of fatigue, now slammed against her ribs like a trapped bird. She looked towards the main door, a slab of reinforced oak that vibrated under the wind's siege.

The Sculptor? Had he come to claim his final pieces?

Her eyes swept the room, searching for a weapon. Her pistol had been rendered useless, lost in the snow hours ago. Her fingers closed around the handle of a rusty ice axe that rested beside the cold fireplace. The metal was cold, but it offered a promise of violence that quelled her tremor.

The knocking repeated, more frantic.

“Open up!” a muffled voice, barely a spectral whisper filtered by the storm.

Elena pressed herself against the wall adjacent to the entrance, raising the ice axe. If it was him, if it was the monster who froze beauty to preserve it, she would split his skull before he could utter one of his phrases about the aesthetics of death.

“Elena!” The cry was clearer this time.

She recognized the voice. Or thought she did. She dropped her guard for a fraction of a second, just enough for doubt to settle in.

With a swift motion, she unbarred the door.

The door didn't open; it exploded inward. A gust of snow rushed in like a miniature avalanche, blinding Elena momentarily and stealing what little warmth remained in the room. A figure wrapped in layers of Gore-Tex and wool collapsed on the threshold, rolling inside.

Elena lunged against the door, using all her weight, digging her boots into the floor to overcome the wind's resistance that tried to keep it open. She cried out with effort, feeling the muscles in her back protest, until she finally managed to close the wooden leaf and re-bolt it.

Relative silence returned, broken only by the newcomer's gasps.

The figure on the floor was a heap of technical clothing covered in frost. He moved clumsily, removing a pair of ski goggles that had protected his eyes from the whiteout.

Arnald Soler looked up.

The forensic pathologist, her mentor, the man who had taught her to read the dead as if they were roadmaps, seemed to have aged ten years in the last few hours. His gray beard was a block of ice; his lips, a bluish, trembling line.

But what chilled Elena's blood was not the cold he brought with him, but the solitude that enveloped him.

Arnald was alone.

Elena kept the ice axe raised, pointing at the man's chest.

“Don’t move,” she warned. Her voice sounded strange in her own ears, metallic and devoid of emotion.

Arnald blinked, his eyes trying to focus on her through his exhaustion. He pulled off a glove with his teeth, revealing a bruised hand that he raised in a gesture of peace.

“Elena… thank God.”

“Where’s Roco?” she asked, ignoring his relief. The question was a test. Arnald’s German Shepherd never left his side. They were a single entity, mind and muscle.

Arnald’s expression broke. A shadow of genuine pain crossed his face, so visible and raw that Elena felt a pang of doubt about her suspicions. The man dropped his head, resting his forehead on the floorboards, breathing with difficulty.

“I lost him,” Arnald croaked. His voice was a broken thread. “On the ridge, before reaching the pass. Visibility was zero… the wind hit us sideways.”

Arnald coughed, a dry sound that shook his body.

“He slipped his leash, Elena. I tried to grab him, but the ground… the ice gave way beneath his paws. He fell down the north slope. I couldn’t… I couldn’t go down for him. The storm would have killed me.”

Elena studied his face. She searched for the lie, the micro-expression that would betray deceit. But she only found the absolute defeat of a man who had to choose between his life and that of his most loyal companion. The dog’s absence left a palpable void in the room, a confirmation that the mountain was unwilling to return anything it took.

“Get up,” she said, lowering the ice axe slightly, though without releasing it.

Arnald rose with difficulty, his joints creaking. His gaze traveled around the room until it stopped at the corner where Lucas lay.

“Is he alive?” he asked, and the clinical tone returned to his voice, displacing the grieving man to make way for the doctor.

“Barely,” Elena replied.

Arnald took off his backpack, letting it drop with a heavy thud, and limped towards Lucas. Elena stepped in his way, blocking his path with her body.

Their eyes met. Moss green against dark brown. History against suspicion.

“Why are you here, Arnald?” Elena’s question was a scalpel. “Last time we spoke, all circumstantial evidence pointed to you. Access to chemicals, knowledge of anatomy, obsession with preservation.”

Arnald didn’t back down. He held her gaze with a weary dignity.

“I’m here because I know how he thinks,” he said, and for the first time, Elena noticed real fear in his pupils. Not fear of her, nor of the storm, but of something worse. “And because I know what he’s going to do next. I’m not The Sculptor, Elena. I was his teacher, yes, at university, decades ago. But he… he has surpassed any theory I could teach.”

“That doesn’t explain why you’ve come here to die.”

“I came because I found this in his old basement lab, the one the police overlooked.”

Arnald reached into the inner pocket of his anorak and pulled out a folded paper, protected by a plastic sleeve. He held it out to her.

Elena took it with her left hand, feeling the scar on her palm tense. She unfolded the document. It was an architectural diagram. Not of a building, but of a hydraulic structure.

The Cavallers Dam.

But over the technical plan were handwritten annotations in elegant, disturbingly precise calligraphy. Red circles marked the lower inspection galleries, those submerged beneath the level of the icy water, where the temperature was constant and close to absolute freezing point.

“‘The Great Refrigerator’,” Elena read aloud, a marginal note written in blue ink.

“He wants to use the dam’s pressure and cold,” Arnald explained, his voice gaining urgency. “It’s not enough for him to freeze his victims in the snow. He wants to encapsulate them. To create an eternal mausoleum where the ice never melts, protected by millions of liters of water.”

Elena looked at the paper, then at Lucas. The connection was instant and terrifying.

“Lucas…” she murmured.

“Lucas is the obstacle,” Arnald said. “But you… you are the central piece, Elena. You always have been. The profiler who sees order in chaos. He wants you to witness his *Magnum Opus*.”

A groan from the straw mattress interrupted the revelation. Lucas stirred, his large, calloused hands clutching the blanket desperately.

“Don’t… go…” he stammered, eyes closed, trapped in the fever’s nightmare. “It’s a… trap.”

Arnald knelt beside him, and this time Elena didn’t stop him. She watched the doctor’s hands move with professional skill, taking his pulse, checking his dilated pupils.

“He has sepsis,” Arnald diagnosed bluntly. “The leg infection has spread. If he doesn’t receive intravenous antibiotics and real warmth in the next six hours, his heart will stop.”

The silence that followed the pronouncement was heavier than the storm.

“We can’t go down to the village,” Elena said. It was a fact, not an opinion. The snow outside was already a meter deep, and visibility was zero. Attempting the descent with a dying man would be suicide.

“No,” Arnald agreed, standing. “But the dam… the dam has maintenance facilities. They have an emergency infirmary for the operators. Generators. Heating.”

Elena looked at him incredulously.

“Are you suggesting we go directly into the wolf’s den?”

“I suggest it’s the only place with electricity and medicine within ten kilometers,” Arnald countered. “And it’s where he is. If we want to end this, if we want Lucas to live, we have to go there.”

Elena walked back to the window. The wind slammed against the shutters as if demanding entry. The idea was madness. Dragging a sick man through the white hell, straight towards a psychopathic killer who knew the terrain better than they did.

But the alternative was to wait. To wait for Lucas’s fever fire to extinguish, leaving him cold like the sculptures the killer left in his wake. To wait for the storm to bury the shelter.

She turned to Arnald. The man was rubbing his hands, trying to regain feeling. He looked fragile, far from the authoritative figure he had been to her years ago. And yet, he had climbed all the way here. He had lost his dog, his only companion, in the attempt.

“How do we take him?” Elena asked.

Arnald pointed towards a corner of the shelter where an old rescue sled lay, a fiberglass stretcher with runners, a relic from some past ski season.

“We tow him. You and I. We take turns.”

“The snow will swallow us,” she said, testing the argument’s soundness.

“The snow has already swallowed us, Elena. The question is whether we want to die still or moving.”

Elena looked at Lucas. His chest rose and fell with an irregular rhythm. The nascent beard on his face accentuated his pallor. She remembered the warmth of his hand when he had pulled her from the river days ago, the endearing clumsiness with which he tried to conceal his limp. There was an alliance between them, forged in initial mistrust and tempered in survival. She couldn’t let him die on that dirty wooden floor.

She approached Arnald’s backpack and began to rummage. She found ropes, carabiners, and a thermos.

“Drink,” she ordered Arnald, handing him the thermos containing the remains of lukewarm broth she had prepared earlier. “You need energy. We leave in ten minutes.”

Arnald nodded gratefully, his trembling hands cradling the container.

Elena knelt beside Lucas one last time. She stroked his cheek, feeling the feverish heat burn her fingertips.

“Lucas, listen to me,” she whispered in his ear. “We’re going for a walk. It’s going to hurt. It’s going to be cold. But I’m not leaving you here.”

Lucas half-opened his eyes. They were two dark wells, veiled by illness, but for an instant, there was a flash of recognition.

“Elena…” His voice was a rasp of sandpaper. “He… he’s waiting for you.”

“I know,” she replied, and felt a glacial calm settle in her chest, displacing fear. It was the same cold determination she felt before entering a crime scene, the necessary detachment to analyze horror without being consumed by it. “And I’m coming for him.”

Preparing the sled was mechanical work. Elena tied Lucas down firmly, wrapping him in all available blankets and covering him with a waterproof tarp secured with elastic cords. He barely protested; consciousness ebbed and flowed like the tide.

Arnald adjusted the dragging straps to his chest. Elena did the same with a second set of improvised ropes. They looked like two draft animals, two beasts of burden preparing for penance.

“The dam is two kilometers away, following the contour line,” Arnald said, checking his compass, though the needle danced erratically due to the storm’s magnetic disturbances. “If we maintain the pace, we’ll arrive in one hour.”

“Or we’ll die in twenty minutes,” Elena corrected.

They approached the door. The roar outside had diminished, but only slightly. It was a deception, a brief respite the storm offered to lure them into its trap.

Elena gripped her ice axe in her right hand, her left holding the towing rope. She looked at Arnald.

“If you fall behind, I won’t stop,” she warned him.

“I know,” he said. There was no reproach in his voice, only acceptance.

Elena opened the door.

The world had turned white. There was no sky or earth, only a vortex of frozen particles. The cold struck her like a physical mallet, stealing the air from her lungs in a single, agonizing instant.

They took the first step.

The sled scraped over the virgin snow. Lucas’s weight was an anchor pulling them back, but the terrain’s incline worked slightly in their favor.

They advanced into nothingness.

Behind them, the shelter door remained open, banging against the frame, a black mouth laughing at their departure. Ahead, the dam waited. And with it, the man who believed death was the only form of perfection.

Elena fixed her gaze on the white void in front of her. Roco was gone. Lucas was fading. Only she remained, the suspect beside her, and the mountain’s indifferent immensity.

She gritted her teeth and pulled.

## Chapter 40: Capítulo 40

The snow didn't fall; it assaulted. Each flake was a shard of glass propelled by a wind that had ceased to be air, transforming into a solid wall, a constant push against the chest that made the simple mechanics of breathing difficult. Elena Vives adjusted her ski goggles, though they were of little use in that white universe where sky and earth had merged into a milky, hostile void.

"Elena..." Lucas Riera's voice reached her fragmented, devoured by the mountain's roar.

She turned. She could barely make out the police officer's silhouette three paces away. Lucas advanced, dragging his right leg, sinking his boot into the deep snow with a grimace of pain that, though invisible beneath layers of thermal clothing, Elena could feel in her own bones. The limp, a constant reminder of his physical fragility, had worsened with the sudden drop in temperature.

"Not far now," she shouted, not to convince him, but to quiet the buzzing of her own anxiety.

She checked her left wrist. The crystal of her father's watch was fogged, but the second hand advanced with its usual mechanical indifference. Three o'clock in the afternoon. The light should have been gray, but the storm had stolen the day, imposing a premature and suffocating twilight.

They followed the GPS track, a blinking blue dot that intermittently lost signal, guiding them towards the old abandoned meteorological station on the northern ridge. According to the old cadastral maps Lucas had unearthed, a basement existed there, a natural permafrost chamber used decades ago for geological samples. The perfect place for someone looking to stop time.

The terrain leveled abruptly. Before them, a geometric, angular, dark shape emerged, breaking the organic anarchy of the snowfall. The concrete building looked like a forgotten bunker, its windows sealed by rotten planks and metal plates.

Lucas leaned against the outer wall, seeking a respite from the gale. His breath formed dense, rapid clouds.

"If he's not here..." he began, but a cough cut him off.

"He is," Elena stated.

It wasn't a logical deduction, but a visceral certainty. Her stomach had tightened into a knot, the same sensation she got before entering a crime scene, that electric vibration that made the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end.

They circled the structure, looking for an entrance. The main door was blocked by an avalanche of debris and old ice. Elena pointed towards a side, where a half-buried maintenance hatch showed signs of recent manipulation: the snow around it wasn't compacted by the wind, but disturbed by a shovel.

Lucas drew his service weapon. The black metal contrasted with the snowy clarity of the landscape. Elena took out her own tactical flashlight and nodded.

The police officer pulled the rusty handle. The metal groaned, a sharp complaint that echoed too loudly in the valley's isolation. They opened the gap just enough to slide inside.

The change was immediate. The howling of the wind died down, replaced by a dense, heavy silence, the kind that seems to press on your eardrums. But it wasn't the silence that stopped Elena dead in her tracks.

It was the smell.

It didn't smell of damp, or mold, or the confinement of forgotten places. The air was permeated with a clinical, pungent aroma: fresh mint and industrial disinfectant. It was a fragrance reminiscent of a hospital, of obsessive cleanliness, of an operating room before the first incision.

"My God," Lucas murmured, lowering his weapon but keeping his finger off the trigger guard.

Elena's beam of light cut through the darkness. They were in a service corridor, with frost-coated pipes running along the low ceiling. The walls had been scrubbed clean; the concrete gleamed, free of dust.

They advanced. The sound of their boots on the clean floor echoed with an obscene clarity. Elena noticed her hands sweating inside her gloves. She took them off, tucking them into her pockets, and ran her thumb over the crescent-shaped scar on her left palm, a nervous tic that sought to anchor her to reality.

At the end of the corridor, a double door of thick plastic, like those used in industrial cold rooms, blocked their way.

Elena looked at Lucas. The police officer's dark eyes reflected the fatigue of the trek and the weight of an illness that was eating away at his time, but in that moment, there was only determination. He pushed the plastic curtains aside.

They entered the gallery.

The space was vast, an old storage room converted. But there were no shelves or boxes. In the center of the room, illuminated by halogen spotlights powered by a silent generator vibrating in some corner, three rectangular blocks stood tall.

They were so transparent they seemed made of glass, but the mist emanating from Elena's mouth confirmed it was ice. Treated, polished ice, preserved at a precise temperature to prevent opaque crystallization.

They approached the first block.

Inside, there was no corpse in the forensic sense of the word. There was no decomposition, no laxity of death. The woman was suspended in the ice, dressed in a white silk tunic that floated around her as if she were underwater. Her hands were clasped over her chest in a gesture of serene prayer. Her blonde hair fanned out perfectly, each strand individualized.

"Marta," Lucas whispered, his voice breaking. He recognized the girl who had disappeared from the neighboring village three months ago.

But it wasn't just Marta. It was an idealized version of her. The makeup was subtle, correcting imperfections; the posture, studied to evoke artificial sanctity.

"He doesn't kill them," Elena said, her voice sounding strangely clinical in her own ears. She forced herself to analyze, not to feel, to raise the mental wall that separated her from the horror. "He... cures them. From his perspective. He stops the deterioration."

She moved towards the second block. A young man. The same imposed placidity. An identical glacial perfection.

And then, the third block.

It was empty.

It wasn't a solid block, but a mold. A coffin of crystal and half-frozen water, awaiting its occupant. Beside it, a metallic workbench, spotless, arranged with maniacal symmetry. Scalpels aligned by size, glass syringes, labeled vials with elegant, antique calligraphy.

Elena approached the table. Among the surgical instruments, there was an object that didn't fit the sterile environment. A leather-bound sketchbook.

She opened it with her fingertips, fearing to contaminate the evidence, or perhaps fearing what she would find.

The pages were filled with anatomical studies. Charcoal illustrations of Renaissance precision. Muscles, tendons, facial expressions. But as she turned the pages, the representations changed. They ceased to be generic.

An eye appeared. A detailed iris with golden flecks on a dark background.
A hand with a crescent-shaped scar.
A profile of a straight nose and thin lips.

Elena stopped breathing. It wasn't just any anatomical study. It was her.

There were portraits of her sleeping, of her walking through the village, of her looking at a glacier. The strokes were loving, devoted, sickening. The artist wasn't trying to capture her life, but to prepare her for eternity.

"Elena... you have to see this," Lucas called from the back of the room.

The police officer was standing in front of a wall that had remained in shadow. When he illuminated it with his flashlight, it revealed a collection of images pinned to the insulating cork. They were snapshots of Lucas. Telephoto lens photographs. Lucas limping. Lucas buying bread. Lucas talking with Elena.

But all the images of Lucas had a peculiarity: they were crossed out with a precise, surgical red X over the face. And beneath each one, a note written in the same elegant calligraphy: *IMPERFECTION. DETERIORATION. WASTE.*

"He knows we're here," Lucas said, turning to her. His hand gripped the pistol handle until his knuckles turned white. "No, wait... he knows *you* would come."

A heavy, metallic clang resonated behind them. The sound of steel pins sliding into place.

It came from the entrance. From the hatch door they had entered through.

Elena ran towards the corridor, her heart pounding against her ribs like a caged animal. She pushed through the plastic curtains and reached the reinforced main access door. She pulled the handle.

Immovable.

"It's locked from the outside!" she shouted, hitting the metal with her fist.

"The generator," Lucas warned from the main room.

The machine's constant hum changed tone. It became sharper, more strained. The halogen lights flickered once, twice, and then went out, plunging them into absolute darkness, broken only by the nervous beams of their flashlights.

And then, a hiss.

It came from the ventilation ducts in the ceiling. It wasn't air. It was a dense, white gas, beginning to fall like a slow cascade onto the gallery floor.

Elena recognized the smell instantly, beneath the mint layer.

"Nitrogen!" she roared, backing away towards the center of the room. "He's purging the oxygen!"

Lucas joined her, illuminating the gas that was accumulating on the floor like a ghostly tide.

"Is he going to suffocate us?"

"No," Elena replied, suddenly understanding the nature of the trap. Her profiler's mind clicked the last piece into place with a terrifying snap. "He's going to preserve us. He wants to lower the temperature until we can't move. He wants us still for the procedure."

The already intense, frigid environment began to bite with renewed ferocity. It wasn't the cold of the outside wind; it was a thermal stillness that penetrated clothes, skin, and flesh, seeking the body's core heat to extinguish it.

Elena looked at the frozen cell, the one that was waiting.
She understood it wasn't for her. She was the muse, the final masterpiece that would require preparation.
The empty receptacle, the waste one, the practice one... was for Lucas.

"We have to get out," Lucas said, his voice weakening. The gas was rising past his ankles.

"There's another way out," Elena said, forcing herself to focus. She remembered the blueprints, the structure of old refrigerators. "The drain. The meltwater channel."

She threw herself to the floor, searching under the tables, ignoring the gas burning her exposed facial skin. There, in the farthest corner, under a cast-iron grate.

"Help me!" she shouted.

Lucas limped to her. Together, they struggled with the grate. It was rusted, fused by years of inactivity and ice. Elena pulled with all her strength until the muscles in her back screamed, until the scar on her hand burned.

"On three," Lucas grunted.

One. Two. Three.

The grate gave way with a dry creak, raising a cloud of rust. Beneath, a dark, narrow, cylindrical tunnel, descending into the bowels of the mountain. It smelled of wet earth and abyss.

"You first," Lucas ordered, pushing her.

"We can't both fit. Your leg..."

"Go!" He pushed her with a force that brooked no argument.

Elena slid into the hole. The concrete tube was barely wider than her shoulders. Darkness swallowed her. She crawled, feeling claustrophobia close her throat, that ancient panic living in her chest awakening violently. *Don't think. Move.*

She heard Lucas enter behind her, the rustling of his body dragging, and then the screech of the grate being put back in place, or perhaps falling.

Above, in the gallery they left behind, a voice distorted by a PA system came to life, filling the air with a soft, cultured, and terrible tone.

"*Impatience is the enemy of perfection, Elena. But I appreciate the enthusiasm. The session has begun.*"

## Chapter 41: Capítulo 41

**West slope of Peguera Peak, Lleida Pyrenees**
**December 26, 2018**

The snow wasn't falling; it was attacking. It was a swarm of white wasps plunging their stingers into the little exposed skin they had left. There was no sky, no ground, no horizon. Only a milky void existed, an absolute nothingness that devoured the world in its wake, erasing their tracks seconds after they were made, as if the mountain refused to admit they had ever been there.

She took one step. Then another. The mechanics of movement had become the only possible religion.

She stopped and turned, shielding her eyes with her gloved hand. Three meters away, Lucas's figure was a dark stain silhouetted against the perpetual gray. His limp, which he usually tried to conceal with masculine pride, was now an agonizing drag. His right leg didn't respond; he dragged it as if it were deadwood, an inert weight anchored to his hip.

"Don't stop," he growled, his voice barely a torn whisper that the wind instantly carried away. He had frost on his eyelashes and skin of a bluish hue that turned her stomach.

Behind her, Doctor Arnald Soler walked hunched over, clutching the straps of his medical backpack with white knuckles. His orange parka was the only color in that monochromatic universe. He looked at her, and in his eyes, she saw the exact reflection of her own terror. He was no longer the mentor, nor the paternal figure who had guided her through the academy's halls; he was a man reduced to instinct, and that made him unpredictable.

"How much further, Elena?" Arnald shouted to be heard over the storm's howl.

She looked at her wrist. The crystal of her father's watch was shattered, a web of fractures distorting the hands. Three forty in the morning. They had been descending for twenty-five minutes that felt like three decades.

"We're close," she lied. Or perhaps not. Spatial orientation was a fantasy in the midst of that cyclogenesis.

She turned back to the slope and continued to break trail. Lucas's pistol weighed in the pocket of her technical jacket, a cold lump against her ribs. Five bullets. Five chances to stop a ghost or to make an irreparable mistake.

The descent became steeper. The virgin snow reached their knees, turning each stride into a muscular battle. Her breath burned, a glacial fire descending her throat and settling in her lungs. 'Claustrophobia,' that insidious voice whispered at the back of her neck. It wasn't the confinement of four walls, but the confinement of the outdoors. The white immensity squeezed tighter than any cell.

Suddenly, the terrain changed. The soft snow gave way to a sheet of hard ice beneath the surface layer.

She heard the moan before the thud.

She turned in time to see Lucas lose his balance. His good leg slipped, and the bad one gave way without protest. He fell heavily onto his side, letting out a choked cry that pierced her chest.

"Lucas!"

She lunged toward him, ignoring the burning in her own thighs. Arnald stood paralyzed for a second before reacting, his movements clumsy from the layers of clothing.

She reached Lucas and grabbed him by the lapels of his coat. His eyes were closed, and his teeth were clenched so tightly that she feared they would break.

"I'm fine," he panted, a lie so obvious it was insulting. He tried to get up, but his body refused to obey.

"Don't move," Arnald ordered, kneeling beside him in the snow. He searched for Lucas's pulse in his neck with trembling fingers. "He's at his limit, Elena. Hypothermia is gaining ground on adrenaline. If we don't get him to shelter in twenty minutes, his heart will start to fail."

"I'm not going to die up here," Lucas spat, opening his eyes. His usually warm brown irises were glazed over. "Help me up."

They helped him up, the two of them. Arnald on the left, Elena on the right. She felt Lucas's dead weight, his body heat escaping through the layers of fabric. He was a big, solid man, but at that moment he seemed made of glass about to shatter.

"Lean on me," she told him in his ear, shouting to overcome the gale. "We're going to find Marc. We're going to get him out of there."

The mention of the child acted like dirty fuel. Lucas nodded, clenched his jaw, and took a step.

They continued. The world narrowed to the rhythm of their forced march. One, two, drag. One, two, drag.

The wind changed direction, bringing a distinct smell with it. It no longer smelled only of ozone and ice. There was something else. A smell of stagnant damp, wet stone, and static electricity.

And then, the concrete beast emerged from the darkness.

First it was just a shadow, an unnatural density in the snow flurry. Then, the straight lines defined themselves. The Cavallers Dam. It wasn't just a retaining wall; it was an inverted cathedral, an obscene curve of human engineering defying the mountain's brutality. It rose before them like a giant tombstone, its concrete walls disappearing into the blackness above and plunging into the abyss below.

She stopped dead, her heart pounding against her ribs like a caged bird. There it was. The final stage.

"My God," Arnald murmured. He had stood petrified, staring at the structure.

The dam seemed to vibrate. She could feel the hum of the turbines, or perhaps it was just the blood pounding in her ears. They knew, thanks to the call, that Marc was in the foundations, in the inspection gallery. They knew the place was connected to the child's pulse. A tomb that would explode if the little one's heart stopped beating.

"The maintenance entrance," she said, pointing toward the eastern end of the crest, where a small cubic building broke the wall's symmetry. "It must be that way."

They dragged Lucas the last 100 meters. The ground leveled out, becoming the asphalt service road, now covered by a treacherous layer of black ice.

Upon reaching the metallic door of the access building, she released Lucas, leaving him leaning against the cold wall. She took out the pistol. The metal stuck to her glove. She disengaged the safety with a click that sounded like a gunshot in the relative silence offered by the wall's shelter.

"Arnald, stay with Lucas," she ordered, without looking at them. Her attention was fixed on the lock.

"Elena, wait..." Lucas began, trying to straighten up, but his legs were like rags.

She approached the door. She expected to find it closed, locked, welded shut. She expected to have to shoot the hinges or look for a window.

But the knob turned in her hand with an oily smoothness.

The door opened inward, revealing a wolf's maw that exhaled a current of air slightly warmer than the outside.

The relief lasted a fraction of a second. It was immediately replaced by a terrifying certainty.

The air emanating from inside didn't smell of machinery, nor grease, nor the dust of places closed for decades.

It smelled of mint.

A chemical, pungent, clean aroma. Antiseptic.

The Sculptor's scent.

He hadn't forced entry. He was waiting for them. The open door wasn't an oversight; it was an invitation.

"What's wrong?" Arnald asked, noticing her hesitation.

She turned toward them. The light of her tactical flashlight illuminated their haggard faces.

"He's here," she whispered, and the words seemed to freeze in the air before reaching them. "He's already inside."

She entered the darkness, pistol first, crossing the threshold into the belly of the beast, knowing that they had just ceased to be hunters to officially become guests.

## Chapter 42: Capítulo 42

**Cavallers Dam, Vall de Boí**
**December 26, 2018**

The metallic click of the latch echoed like a gunshot in an empty cathedral. As we pushed the heavy steel door shut behind us, the storm's howl was abruptly severed, replaced by a silence heavier than the snow itself. It wasn't merely the absence of noise, but a dense, oily presence that clung to wet clothes and seeped into one's ears.

I raised my tactical flashlight. The beam of white light cut through the blackness, revealing a raw concrete corridor that stretched into the bowels of the mountain. The walls wept. Threads of icy water slipped down the gray stone, feeding dark puddles on the ground that reflected our distorted intrusion.

"Elena?" Lucas's voice sounded hoarse, amplified by the tunnel's tubular acoustics.

I turned. The police officer leaned against the doorway, his cerulean face under the artificial light. His right leg bore no weight; he held it at an odd angle, and his knuckles were white from the force with which he clutched his side. Beside him, Doctor Arnald Soler breathed with difficulty, adjusting the straps of his medical pack with nervous, almost spasmodic movements. His eyes darted from the shadows to my gun.

"We're inside," I whispered, checking the weapon's safety for the umpteenth time. "Don't make a sound. Concrete carries sound better than air."

"It's an inspection gallery," Soler murmured, running a gloved finger along the damp wall. "These dams have miles of tunnels to monitor for leaks. He could be anywhere."

"Not anywhere," Lucas corrected, limping towards me. Pain was etched in the corners of his lips, taut as violin strings. "He'll look for the coldest spot. Where the temperature is constant."

I nodded, forcing my lungs to accept the stale air. It smelled of stale damp, ancient mold, and something else. Something chemical. Sharp.

I moved forward. My military boots, soaked through to the socks, made a dull, sticky sound on the soaked ground. The flashlight was my only defense against the absolute darkness that swallowed us. Every few meters, rusted pipes crossed the low ceiling like varicose veins of a sleeping giant.

My mind, trained to dissect crime scenes, began to catalog the environment. There was no dust. The floor was clean in the center, recently swept. Someone had been here, dragging something heavy that had left a subtle groove in the accumulated slime.

"Look at the floor!" I said, lowering the beam of light.

Two parallel lines furrowed the dirt, disappearing into the shroud of gloom that stretched ahead.

"Drag marks," Lucas stated, drawing his useless radio purely by police instinct before putting it away with a gesture of frustration. "Recent. The water hasn't erased them yet."

"Marc!" The word escaped Soler's throat, laden with a fear that sounded too genuine.

"Doctor, stay behind me," I ordered, without looking at him. Distrust was an animal scratching at the back of my neck. Soler knew this place too well, and his insistence on accompanying us bordered on the pathological. "Lucas, you cover the rear. If you can't walk, tell me now. I can't carry you."

"I can run if I have to," he lied. I knew it was a lie, he knew I knew it, but in that cement hell, pious lies were the only fuel we had left.

We delved deeper into the gallery. The temperature dropped with every step. It wasn't the sharp cold of the outer wind, but a frigid stillness that penetrated to the bone marrow, slowing the pulse. My breath formed ephemeral clouds before the light.

Suddenly, I smelled it.

I stopped dead, raising my left hand to stop the men.

"What is it?" Arnald whispered, almost colliding with Lucas's back.

I inhaled through my nose, seeking to confirm the alarm signal my reptilian brain had just sent. There it was. Beneath the stench of stagnant water and rust. A clean, surgical fragrance that did not belong in this godforsaken place.

Mint. And industrial disinfectant.

The scent of preserved death.

"He's here," I said, and my voice sounded strange and distant. "The Sculptor is here."

The tension in the tunnel skyrocketed. Lucas tensed his shoulders, momentarily forgetting his injured leg. Soler brought a hand to his mouth.

"How do you know?" the doctor asked, his eyes wide with fear.

"Because it smells like an operating room," I replied, resuming the advance, this time with my weapon raised and my finger caressing the trigger guard.

The tunnel opened into a wider room, a valve chamber where the ceiling rose several meters. In the center, a huge steel pipe descended vertically, disappearing into the floor. The roar of pressurized water circulating inside the conduit was a deep vibration felt in the molars more than heard.

But it wasn't the machinery that stopped my heart for a beat.

At the back of the room, illuminated by a construction light connected to a portable generator that hummed softly, was a staged scene.

It wasn't Marc.

It was a sewing mannequin, one of those old, headless ones, with a stained beige cloth torso. It was placed on a hand-carved ice pedestal. The block was translucent, perfect, without a single air bubble inside. A feat of thermal engineering impossible under these rudimentary conditions.

On the mannequin's torso, pinned with a scalpel, was a Polaroid photograph.

I approached, feeling how gravity seemed to increase, pulling my limbs towards the floor. Lucas limped to my side, his breathing a painful wheeze.

My flashlight's beam illuminated the photo.

It was me.

A photo taken from a distance, through a window. I was in my city apartment, sitting at my desk full of case files, my head in my hands. The date written in black marker on the bottom white border read: *Three days before coming here*.

"He was waiting for you," Lucas whispered. The understanding in his tone was devastating. "Elena, this isn't about Marc. Marc is the bait."

"The dam..." Arnald's voice trembled. "He's not trying to hide anything. He's exhibiting."

I moved closer to the ice pedestal. The cold emanating from it bit at my face. Inside the frozen block, suspended like an insect in amber, there was something. It wasn't pure water.

I brought the flashlight closer to the ice.

In the center of the block, perfectly preserved, was a wristwatch. A Rolex Submariner with the strap unclasped.

"It's Marc's," Arnald said, choking back a cry. "I gave it to him when he finished his residency."

The watch read 03:55.

I looked at my own wrist, at my father's old watch. The hands showed 03:50.

Five minutes left.

"It's a countdown," I said, and panic, cold and sharp, tried to take control of my hands. "It's not the time of death. It's showtime."

A metallic sound, strident and rhythmic, began to echo from the opposite tunnel, the one that plunged even deeper into the dam's darkness.

*Clang. Clang. Clang.*

Someone was hitting a metal railing with a tool. The rhythm was slow, deliberate. An invitation.

"Welcome, Elena," a voice distorted by the echo, devoid of humanity, bounced off the concrete walls, coming from everywhere and nowhere. "The canvas is prepared."

Lucas stepped between the darkness and me, raising his trembling flashlight.

"Police!" he yelled, but his voice cracked. "Come out with your hands up!"

We only got a soft, dry laugh, like dead leaves rustling in the wind.

"Beauty requires sacrifice, Agent Riera," replied the voice, now closer, coming from the shadows behind the immense pipe. "And the cold... the cold is the only one that never lies."

The generator's hum abruptly stopped. The construction light went out.

Darkness fell upon us like a granite slab, absolute and total, only broken by the trembling beam of my flashlight that now pointed at nothing. And in that blackness, the scent of mint became unbearably strong, right behind me.

## Chapter 43: Capítulo 43

The air inside the subterranean chamber bore no resemblance to the storm raging on the surface. If outside the “White Beast” was a chaos of wind and snow, down here an unnatural silence reigned, broken only by the rhythmic hum of generators.

Elena Vives crossed the reinforced metal threshold. The change in pressure momentarily plugged her ears. Her fingers instinctively sought the face of her father's watch on her wrist, a tactile anchor against the unreality unfolding before her green eyes. This was no ordinary basement. The walls were covered with immaculate white insulating panels, reflecting a bluish light that emanated from the center of the room.

"Tell me I'm not seeing what I think I'm seeing," Lucas Riera murmured behind her.

The police officer's voice was hoarse, laden with a fatigue that went beyond the physical pain in his right leg. Elena heard the characteristic drag of his boot against the clinical linoleum floor; his limp had worsened with the humidity and the effort of the descent.

"Don't look at the floor, Lucas," she warned, her own voice devoid of inflection, in a purely analytical mode. "Look up."

The "Sculptor's Workshop" was not designed to hide corpses, but to display them.

In the center of the room, dominating the space like a pagan altar, stood a two-meter-high reinforced glass cylinder. It was connected to thick hoses that pumped a viscous, transparent liquid, maintaining a temperature Elena could feel on her skin even several steps away. An absolute, chemical cold.

Inside the tank floated the figure.

Elena approached, forcing her legs to ignore the instinct to flee. The crescent-shaped scar on her left palm throbbed, a phantom reminder of old wounds, but her profiler's mind took control. There was no decomposition. No lividity. The preservation was so perfect it was obscene.

It was a young girl. Barely a teenager. Her ash-blonde hair floated around her head like a weightless halo, and her eyes were closed with a disturbing serenity. She wore an immaculate antique lace white dress.

"The technique is... different," Elena whispered, approaching the glass. Her breath did not fog the surface; the ventilation system absorbed any moisture. "It's not standard cryogenization. It's chemical suspension. He has vitrified her."

Lucas stood beside her. The large man, broad-shouldered and with calloused hands accustomed to dealing with drunks and lost tourists, seemed to shrink before the sight. His face, marked by exhaustion and the shadow of a three-day stubble, paled under the cyanotic lighting.

"It can't be," Lucas's whisper was a strangled thread of a voice.

Elena turned to him. She detected the trembling in the police officer's hands, the way his jaw tensed to suppress a retch.

"Do you know her?" she asked. It wasn't an accusation, but a need for data.

Lucas leaned heavily on a nearby metal table, covered with surgical instruments aligned with meticulous precision. The smell of mint and antiseptic, the olfactory signature they had traced to this place, was overwhelming in that corner.

"It's Julia," he said, and the name came out laden with an ancient pain. "Arnald's daughter."

Elena looked back at the tank. The piece clicked into place with a deafening mental snap. The obsession with purity. The rejection of the corruption of flesh.

"She disappeared fifteen years ago," Lucas continued, his gaze fixed on the girl's suspended face. "It was said she had eloped with a boyfriend to the coast. Arnald... he played the role of the devastated father. He organized search parties. He cried in my office."

Elena observed the girl's features. She had the same bone structure as Doctor Soler, that aristocratic and cold beauty. But where Arnald had an icy gaze, this girl retained an eternal innocence, frozen in time.

"She didn't elope," Elena deduced, her mind working at full speed. "He couldn't allow her to grow. To change."

"She was sixteen years old," Lucas ran a hand through his dark hair, where premature gray strands gleamed under the artificial light. "She was the living image of goodness in this valley. Arnald always said the world didn't deserve her. That life would eventually taint her."

"And he decided to save her," she concluded, feeling an icy nausea in her stomach. "To preserve her before time could touch her. This is his 'Masterpiece', Lucas. Everything else... the other victims... they were rehearsals. Tests to perfect the formula that would keep her like this forever."

Elena circled the tank slowly. At the base of the cylinder, an engraved metal plate bore a single Latin word: *AETERNITAS*.

The profiler then understood the magnitude of the monster they faced. Arnald Soler didn't kill out of sadism, nor a conventional sexual impulse. He killed to stop the clock. His psychopathy was a rebellion against mortality itself, a desperate and bloody attempt to freeze a moment of perceived perfection.

"If she's here..." Lucas straightened up, his hand descending to the holster of his weapon, although the gesture seemed futile against the horror before them, "it means he never left. That he's been coming down here every day, for fifteen years, to look at her."

"To care for her," Elena corrected. She pointed to the monitors flashing with constant readings. "The maintenance of this equipment requires daily attention. It's a sanctuary, Lucas. And we have desecrated it."

A metallic sound, heavy and dry, echoed from the chamber's entrance, behind them. It wasn't the wind. It was the locking mechanism of the security door.

The hum of the generators changed tone, becoming sharper, more urgent.

Elena and Lucas turned in unison. The figure silhouetted in the doorway wore no mask. He didn't need one down here, in his domain. Arnald Soler watched them with those ice-blue eyes that now seemed to reflect the same emptiness as his daughter's tank. He wore a rubber apron over his impeccable clothes, and the smell of mint seemed to intensify, flooding the room until it was difficult to breathe.

"Julia is a light sleeper," the doctor said, his voice soft, paternal, freezing Elena's blood more than any shouted threat. "And we don't like uninvited guests."

Lucas drew his weapon, but his movement was slow, clumsy due to the pain in his leg and the weight of the truth he had just discovered. Arnald didn't even blink. He held a remote device in his right hand, a small control with a single red button that pulsed rhythmically.

"Beauty is fragile, Agent Riera," Arnald continued, taking a step inside as the door finished sealing behind him with a hydraulic hiss. "It requires sacrifices to remain intact."

Elena looked at the tank, then at the father, and finally at the control in his hand. She understood the implicit threat. He wasn't going to kill them directly. He was going to incorporate them into the collection, or worse, he would destroy the sanctuary with them inside to protect his secret.

"It's not love, Arnald," Elena said, stepping forward, interposing herself between Lucas's weapon and the doctor. She needed time, she needed him to talk. "It's taxidermy. You've turned her into an object."

"I have made her eternal, dear Elena. And now, you will be the witnesses to her immortality... or the foundations of her new temple."

## Chapter 44: Capítulo 44

CAPÍTULO: 44 - Chapter 44

# Chapter 44

The metallic echo of the bolt sliding home was definitive, a dry sound that decapitated any hope of immediate return. Lucas Riera slammed his shoulder against the door, a dull thud that barely made the reinforced steel panel vibrate. The police chief let out a grunt, a mix of pain and frustration, as the vibration of the impact traveled up his arm to his neck.

“It’s sealed,” he said, his hoarse voice bouncing off the bare concrete walls. “Hydraulic. Arnald has guided us exactly where he wanted us.”

Elena Vives didn’t respond immediately. Her attention was captive to the oppressive atmosphere of the maintenance corridor. The air down there wasn't just cold; it had a mineral density, laden with stagnant moisture and static electricity. The emergency lights flickered erratically, casting shadows that seemed to stretch like deformed fingers over the rusted pipes running across the ceiling.

The former profiler closed her eyes for an instant, fighting against the pressure that was beginning to build in her chest. The walls seemed to lean inward. *It’s not the place, it’s your mind. Categorize. Analyze.* She opened her eyelids, revealing the moss-green of her irises, now darkened by the gloom.

“He hasn’t locked us in to starve us to death, Lucas,” she whispered, forcing her breathing to maintain a slow rhythm. “If he wanted to kill us, he would have done it upstairs. This is an antechamber. He wants us to see something before the final act.”

Lucas stepped away from the door, limping visibly. The tunnel’s dampness was seeping into his joints, and his right knee, that old enemy that predicted storms, now howled with every step.

“See what?” he asked, shining his flashlight into the depths of the corridor. “All I see is rust and cement. We’re below the lake level, Elena. Millions of liters of water pushing down on our heads.”

“The process,” she replied, advancing into the darkness. “A narcissist of his caliber needs witnesses who understand his ‘genius.’ The act isn’t enough; he needs the critique.”

They walked in single file. The floor was a metal grate over an unfathomable void where the constant drip of distant leaks could be heard. The roar of the turbines was a background vibration, a tectonic heartbeat felt more in the teeth than in the ears.

About fifty meters ahead, the corridor widened. It wasn’t an exit, but an old spare parts storage, a cavity dug into the living rock and lined with industrial brick. But something clashed violently with the decrepitude of the surroundings.

In the center of the chamber, illuminated by a white, almost surgical light emanating from portable halogen lamps, was an immaculate workspace.

Elena stopped dead. The smell hit her before the sight. It didn't smell of engine grease or mold. It smelled of peppermint and antiseptic solutions. A clean, sharp aroma that stung the nostrils.

“My God,” Lucas murmured, lowering the beam of light.

They had found the Sculptor’s workshop.

There were no corpses, but death was present in every detail. A stainless steel table, polished to a mirror sheen, dominated the center. On it, aligned with obsessive geometric precision, rested instruments that did not belong in a hydroelectric dam: scalpels, retractors, drainage cannulas, and rolls of thermal bandages.

Elena approached, her gloved hands hovering over the objects without touching them. Her mind began to reconstruct Arnald’s movements. *Order. Control. Symmetry.*

“Look at this,” said Lucas, pointing to a corkboard on the back wall.

It was covered in sketches. They weren’t a madman’s scribbles, but anatomical drawings of superb technical quality, rendered in charcoal. They depicted postures, angles of repose, facial expressions of absolute serenity. Elena recognized the faces. They were the victims of the past ten years. But in the drawings, they didn’t look dead; they looked asleep, eternal, liberated from the deterioration of time.

In the center of the panel, the largest and most detailed sketch showed Julia. Below it, a note in elegant, old-fashioned cursive calligraphy: *The Ice Pietà. Opus Magnum.*

“These aren’t murders to him,” Elena said, feeling a chill that had nothing to do with the ambient temperature. She rubbed the scar on her left palm with her thumb, a nervous tic that betrayed her agitation. “It’s curation. Arnald believes he’s rescuing beauty from biological corruption.”

Lucas approached a side desk where a thick, leather-bound notebook lay. He opened it cautiously. His large, calloused hands seemed clumsy against the delicacy of the paper.

“It’s a journal,” Lucas read, squinting under the harsh light. “There are chemical formulas. Refrigerant mixtures… Freezing times. He speaks of ‘cellular crystallization without rupture.’”

“He’s perfecting the technique,” Elena said, standing beside him and reading over his shoulder. “The first victims were trials. Errors. That’s why he abandoned them when the ice burned the skin or deformed the features. But with Julia… he believes he has succeeded.”

“’The subject must be alive for the transition,’” Lucas read aloud, and the phrase hung in the frigid air like a sentence. “’Fear preserves the expression. Adrenaline acts as a fixative before the cold.’”

Lucas slammed the book shut, a dry crack that echoed like a gunshot.

“She’s alive, Elena. He has her ready for the… ‘transition.’”

“The turbine hall,” Elena deduced, turning towards the only other door in the chamber, a heavy bulkhead with an opening wheel. “He needs massive energy for the industrial cooling systems. He’s connected his equipment to the dam’s main grid.”

Elena walked towards the bulkhead. She could feel the vibration on the other side, much stronger now. It was the heart of the beast, the place where the brute force of water was transformed into electricity. Arnald Soler was waiting for them there.

She adjusted her father’s watch on her wrist, checking the time purely out of habit, seeking an anchor of reality. The hands advanced inexorably.

“Lucas,” she said without turning, “when we cross this door, there will be no negotiation. He doesn’t see people; he sees raw material. If we try to reason with him, Julia will die.”

The police officer drew his service weapon. The black metal seemed to absorb the aseptic light of the workshop. His face, marked by fatigue and physical pain, hardened until it seemed carved from the very rock of the mountain.

“I’m not going to reason with him,” Lucas assured her.

Elena gripped the bulkhead’s wheel. The metal was icy, biting her skin through the fabric. She strained. The mechanism groaned, a protest of rust and disuse, but it yielded. She turned the wheel once, twice. The hermetic seal broke with a hiss of pressurized air.

The sound that entered was deafening. The mechanical din of the generators drowned out any other sound. Elena pushed the door open, and the amber light of the machine room spilled over them, bathing the immaculate workshop in a sickly hue.

They stepped towards the threshold, leaving behind the theory, the sketches, and the ordered madness, to enter the chaos.

## Chapter 45: Capítulo 45

The concrete of the Cavallers dam wasn't merely cold; it exhaled a mineral chill, ancient, like the breath of a hibernating beast. Elena Vives descended the next flight of metal stairs, her gloved hand brushing against the rusted railing. The metal vibrated beneath her fingers, a deep, constant resonance born from the structure's bowels, where the turbines battled against the pressure of millions of liters of water.

Behind her, Lucas Riera's footsteps were irregular. The drag of his right boot against the grated floor broke the hypnotic cadence of the electric hum. Elena paused for a moment on the landing, then turned. The emergency light, an agonizing red that flickered every four seconds, bathed the policeman's face. Lucas's skin was the color of damp ash, beaded with a sweat that didn't match the tunnel's freezing temperature.

"I'm fine," he grunted before she could ask the question. His voice was sandpaper on stone. "Keep going."

Elena nodded, though her profiler's eyes registered the tension in his jaw, the way his knuckles whitened as he gripped his service weapon. He didn't have much time left. Neither did either of them.

They continued their descent into the lower inspection gallery. The air down there was dense, heavy with the smell of ozone and stagnant water that clung to the palate. The dam's architecture, brutalist and oppressive, seemed designed to crush the human spirit. For Elena, every meter they descended was a turn of the screw in her chest. The walls seemed to close in. The immensity of the water contained on the other side of the concrete wall weighed on the back of her neck like a physical sentence. *Claustrophobia*, her mind whispered, but she pushed it into a dark corner of her consciousness, locking the door. Not now.

At the end of the corridor, a reinforced steel door stood out from the others. It lacked the rust and neglect that characterized the rest of the maintenance facilities. Its bolt gleamed, freshly greased, and a strip of white, clinical light escaped from the gap at the bottom, slicing through the red gloom of the corridor.

Elena raised a fist, signaling them to stop. Lucas pressed himself against the wall, ignoring the pain such a movement must have caused his injured leg. With a synchronization born of desperate necessity, she pushed the handle. The door yielded without a creak.

They entered with weapons raised, sweeping the space in a tense arc.

No one was there. But what they found made Elena slowly lower her pistol, feeling the bile rise in her throat.

It wasn't a machine room. It was a sanctuary.

The space, originally intended for storing generator spare parts, had been transformed with a sickening meticulousness. The concrete walls were covered with immaculate white tarpaulins, creating a sterile chamber within the industrial monster. In the center, a stainless steel table, clean to a surgical gleam, held a series of instruments aligned by size: scalpels, retractors, thick-gauge needles, and rolls of gauze.

But it wasn't the medical equipment that stopped Elena's breath. It was the drawings.

Dozens of charcoal sketches were taped to the tarpaulins. Anatomical studies of Renaissance precision. A hand relaxed in death. The curve of an exposed neck. A closed eye, every lash detailed with maniacal obsession. All showed the same face.

"Julia," Lucas whispered. The name left his mouth like a broken prayer.

The policeman limped toward the side workbench, where a laptop rested beside a digital voice recorder and several black leather notebooks.

Elena approached the drawings. The technique was superb, but it revealed a soulless vision. To its creator, this was not a person, but a composition of flesh and bone to be perfected. The "Sculptor." The nickname now took on a literal and terrifying meaning.

"Look at this," Lucas said, his voice trembling with barely contained fury.

Elena joined him at the table. A topographical map of the dam was spread out, with red ink annotations marking the main turbine hall, the "Atrium." But what captured her attention was the recorder. Beside it, a bandage stained with dried blood and an empty bottle of potent painkillers.

"He's injured," Elena deduced, touching the bandage. "He survived the cave-in, but he didn't come out unscathed."

She pressed the play button, and the tape spun with a soft hiss.

'Entry 412. The subject shows signs of accelerated cellular deterioration after the last cooling phase. The imperfection of the flesh is... disappointing. Beauty is ephemeral only if we allow entropy to win.'

Arnald Soler's voice filled the room, calm, cultured, with that pedagogical cadence Elena had heard so many times when he analyzed a case with her.

'I've had to adjust the nitrogen mixture. The process must be absolute. I'm not seeking death, Julia. I'm seeking the pause. Static eternity.'

There was a pause in the recording, then a metallic sound, as if Arnald had struck the table.

'The intrusion of Vives and the local policeman has accelerated the timeline. They don't understand the work. They only see the crime, not the preservation. I had to abandon the home laboratory, but the Atrium will provide the necessary energy for the final immersion. If I cannot keep you in this world under my conditions... I will take you to the next in a state of unalterable perfection.'

Elena stopped the recording. The silence returned, heavier than before.

"He wasn't talking to anyone in the ventilation shaft that time," Elena murmured, as the pieces of the puzzle clicked into place in her mind. "He was recording himself. Documenting his "Great Work." His narcissism is such that he needs an audience, even a future one."

"He's insane," Lucas spat, striking the table with his uninjured fist. "He has her down there. He's going to kill her."

"No," Elena corrected. The moss-green of her irises darkened as her eyelids opened again. "In his mind, he's saving her. He believes biological life is a corruption. He wants to freeze her at the exact moment he considers perfect. It's worse than murder, Lucas. It's total objectification."

Elena picked up one of the notebooks. She opened it at random. They weren't just medical notes; they were philosophical delusions mixed with hydraulic engineering calculations. Arnald had planned this for months, perhaps years. The dam wasn't an emergency hideout; it was his chosen cathedral from the start. The hydroelectric power provided him with the massive energy needed for his improvised cryogenization units.

Lucas pushed away from the table, breathing heavily. He put a hand to his chest, rubbing his sternum.

"Where is she?" he asked, looking towards the room's only other door, a watertight bulkhead at the far end.

Elena followed his gaze. That door led deeper. Towards the roar.

"In the Atrium, the turbine room," she replied, slipping the recorder into her pocket. "They'll need the proof if they get out of this. That's where the cold is most intense and the energy purest."

She checked her pistol's magazine. Full. She had 14 bullets to stop a man who knew every corner of her psyche, a man who had been her mentor and who now threatened to turn a girl into an ice statue.

"Lucas," she said, approaching him. She placed a hand on his shoulder. The fabric of his coat was damp. "If we go in there, there's no turning back. He knows this place. He's had time to prepare it."

The police chief looked at her. The pain in his brown eyes had been replaced by a granite-like determination. Loyalty, his greatest virtue and his greatest weakness, had now been forged into a weapon.

Elena nodded. There was nothing more to say.

They left the false sanctuary, leaving behind the white light and the drawings of the dead girl. The outer corridor seemed even darker in contrast. The sound of the turbines grew as they advanced, transforming from a hum into a physical roar that made their teeth rattle.

They reached a circular gallery that surrounded the dam's central shaft. Below, in the darkness, the black water churned. A grated bridge crossed the void towards a suspended central structure: the sluice gate control room, the antechamber to the Atrium.

Elena advanced first, her weapon held close to her body. The air was freezing, sharp as razor blades. Her breath formed white clouds that quickly dissipated in the forced airflow.

Halfway across the bridge, something caught her attention. On the grated floor, a drop of fresh blood gleamed under the dim light, red and viscous. Arnald had passed this way recently. The wound he had tended in the sanctuary must have reopened from the exertion. He was human. He bled. He could die.

That thought was the anchor Elena clung to as a glacial fear struggled to immobilize her legs. Arnald Soler was not a ghost, nor a supernatural monster, nor a force of nature. He was an arrogant, wounded, and desperate man.

They reached the end of the walkway. Before them stood the entrance to the Atrium, two colossal doors of riveted metal. There was no electronic lock, only a manual opening wheel, heavy and cold.

Lucas positioned himself on one side of the frame, Elena on the other. Their gazes met one last time. In that silent exchange, everything they couldn't express with words condensed: fear, trust, and the certainty that one or perhaps both of them would not see the dawn.

Elena gripped the wheel with both hands. The metal bit into her palms through her gloves. She pulled hard. The mechanism groaned, a protest of rusted steel that echoed through the concrete cavern. She turned it once. Twice.

The door unlatched with a dull *clank* that reverberated like a gunshot.

Elena pushed. The metal leaf swung inward, revealing a vast darkness, broken only by the bluish glow of control panels and steam rising from the floor like fog in a graveyard.

The cold that poured from the room hit their faces, so intense it burned.

"Let's go," Elena said, and took the first step towards the end of everything.

## Chapter 46: Capítulo 46

The roar of the turbines in the bowels of the Cavallers dam was not a sound, but a tectonic vibration that ascended through the soles of their boots, making their teeth chatter. Elena Vives forced herself to ignore the pressure of thousands of tons of water looming above their heads, separated from them by mere meters of reinforced concrete. Her attention, sharpened by the panic she struggled to tame, converged on a single point: the reinforced polycarbonate cylinder situated in the center of the engine room.

Inside, suspended in a viscous, translucent solution, Julia floated.

She didn't look dead. She looked like an offering to a winter god. Her hair formed a static halo around her pale face, and the bluish illumination from the control panels lent her skin the gleam of antique porcelain.

“Don't touch her,” Doctor Arnald Soler's voice cut through the glacial air with the precision of a scalpel.

Lucas Riera, standing three paces from the doctor, adjusted his grip on his service weapon. His knuckles, white with tension, contrasted sharply with the dark metal. The police officer's right leg trembled imperceptibly, the phantom pain of an old injury awakened by the tunnel's aggressive humidity, but his stance remained as firm as the mountain's bedrock.

“Step away from the console, Arnald,” Lucas ordered. His tone lacked the usual warmth of the local police chief; it was gravel and warning.

The Sculptor, now stripped of his mask as an affable mentor, did not flinch. His ice-blue eyes, inexpressive and devoid of any human remorse, shifted from Lucas's pistol to Elena's face. There was an obscene neatness about him; even in that industrial basement, he exuded that clinical scent of mint and antiseptic that Elena now recognized as the aroma of madness.

“If I step away, she dies,” Arnald said with didactic calm, as if explaining a routine diagnosis. “The vitrification process is unstable. If you abruptly interrupt the cryoprotectant flow, the water in her cells will expand. Ice crystals will tear her apart from within. It will be... biologically disastrous. And aesthetically unforgivable.”

Elena felt an acidic nausea rise in her throat. She glanced at her father's watch on her left wrist. The hands advanced relentlessly. The storm outside, the “White Beast,” howled so loudly that its lament seeped through the ventilation shafts, competing with the turbines.

“You put her in there,” Elena's whisper was more terrifying than a scream. Her moss-green eyes, usually analytical, burned with a primitive fury. “You're the one who knows how to get her out. Do it. Now.”

She moved closer to the tank, searching for any sign of life in the girl's chest. The crescent-shaped scar on her left palm itched, a somatic sign that always preceded disaster.

“Elena, my dear, you were always my brightest student, but you lack vision,” Arnald typed a sequence into the panel. An amber light flickered at the base of the cylinder. “I didn't put her in there. I preserved her. The outside world is decay, entropy. Here, in the ice, beauty is absolute. Eternal. Didn't you seek order in the chaos of glaciers? This is the supreme order.”

“Defrost, Arnald!” Lucas bellowed, stepping forward, dragging his heavy boot across the metal grating. The metallic echo resonated like a misfired shot.

The doctor sighed, a theatrical gesture of disappointment.

“Very well. But it requires precision. A single degree of error, and thermal shock will stop her heart before it can beat again.”

Arnald began to manipulate the hydraulic valves. The liquid inside the tank began to bubble, its level slowly descending. The scent of ozone and chemicals intensified, mingling with the stale humidity of the subsoil.

Elena observed every movement of the doctor's hands. A surgeon's hands. A killer's hands. Her profiler's mind, which she had tried to silence for years under layers of snow and geological study, now worked at full throttle. *Narcissist. Complete control. He feels superior to us. He won't yield his masterpiece without one last act of arrogance.*

“Lucas, don't take your eyes off him,” she warned, circling the tank to position herself on the other side, searching for a manual emergency valve. “He's enjoying this.”

“I've got him, Elena. One false move and I'll blow his knee out.”

The liquid drained, leaving Julia exposed to the cold air of the room. Her body slumped gently against the curved glass, inert. Her skin had an unnatural bluish tint.

“Phase one complete,” Arnald announced without looking at them. “Now, thermal resuscitation. I need access to the secondary panel. It's behind you, Lucas.”

The police officer didn't move.

“Tell me what to touch. You're not moving from there.”

Arnald smiled, a thin grimace that didn't reach his eyes.

“It's a biometric security system, Lucas. Fingerprint. Unless you want to cut off my hand, you'll have to let me through.”

Lucas hesitated for a fraction of a second. His eyes sought Elena's. She nodded slightly, her stomach a knot of wire. They had no choice. Julia's life hung on the technical vanity of a monster.

“Slowly,” Lucas growled, pivoting on his good leg to let him pass, but keeping the barrel of his pistol pressed against the doctor's ribs.

Arnald advanced. As he passed Lucas, the entire building shook.

It wasn't a metaphor. A violent jolt ran through the concrete structure. The room's lights flickered and died for two eternal seconds before the emergency generators kicked in, bathing the space in a nightmarish red light.

“The power grid is down,” Elena said, her voice trembling for the first time. Claustrophobia, that old enemy, clawed at the walls of her mind. The darkness, the weight of the mountain, the confinement...

“Life support systems will fail in three minutes,” Arnald informed, his voice strangely animated by the chaos. “If we don't manually stabilize the temperature, she will die.”

Capitalizing on the distraction of the blackout and the change in light, Arnald acted. He didn't go towards the biometric panel. With a fluid movement, uncharacteristic of his age, he spun on his heels and struck Lucas's bad knee with his elbow.

The crunch was audible. Lucas bellowed in pain, and his right leg gave way beneath his weight, sending him to his knees. The shot went wide, hitting a steam pipe that burst with a deafening hiss, filling the space between them with scorching white mist.

“Lucas!” Elena cried, lunging forward.

Arnald was no longer by the panel. He had merged with the cloud of steam, a shadow moving with purpose.

“The tank, Elena!” Lucas shouted from the floor, struggling to stand as he clutched his leg. “Forget about me, save the girl!”

Elena stopped dead, torn between the instinct to help her partner and the need to protect the victim. Through the mist, she saw Arnald's silhouette manipulating a red lever beside the emergency exit.

“Beauty is ephemeral if not cared for, Elena,” the doctor's voice came, distorted by the roar of the steam. “But tragedy... tragedy lasts forever.”

He pulled the lever.

A heavy, final mechanical sound resonated through the room. The tunnel's security gates began to descend. He wasn't just escaping; he was trapping them. And worse still, he had activated the tank's purge protocol.

The cylinder where Julia lay began to vibrate. It wasn't warming. It was cooling again, rapidly, seeking absolute zero.

Elena ran to the console, her hands flying over controls she barely understood, guided only by desperate logic and the technical manuals she had devoured nights ago.

“Lucas, the door!” she cried without looking back. “If it closes, we'll run out of oxygen!”

Lucas, his face beaded with sweat from the agonizing pain, crawled. He couldn't walk, but he could shoot. He aimed at the hydraulic control box that regulated the descending gate. His large, calloused hands, usually steady, trembled with the effort of maintaining consciousness.

*One shot. I only have one shot before the steam blinds me.*

The roar of the dam seemed to mock them. Elena fought against the machine; Lucas fought against his own body. And Arnald Soler, the Sculptor, disappeared into the darkness of the service tunnels, leaving his broken masterpiece behind.

Elena twisted a valve, burning the palm of her hand on the icy metal. Julia's temperature indicator stopped in the critical zone.

“Hold on, girl!” she pleaded with the inert body. “Don't you dare give up now!”

Lucas's shot thundered in the room, a dry sound that seemed to stop time.

## Chapter 47: Capítulo 47

**Cavallers Dam, Vall de Boí**
**December 26, 2018**
**04:32**

The sound wasn't heard; it was felt in the marrow of her bones. A low-pitched roar, a tectonic vibration born in the mountain's depths, ascending through the concrete to rattle Elena Vives's teeth.

She was in the Atrium.

It wasn't a cathedral, but the belly of an engineering beast. The metal catwalk beneath her boots vibrated with the fury of thousands of liters of water pressing against the floodgates. Elena raised her tactical flashlight, its beam slicing through the absolute darkness like a scalpel in an infected wound. The air smelled of ancient damp, of silt, and of that static electricity that precedes tragedies.

"Lucas?" Her voice broke, insignificant against the roar of the hydraulic machinery.

She pointed downwards. The abyss opened at her feet, a fifteen-meter drop into the Valve Chamber.

He was there.

The sight struck her chest with the force of a physical hammer. Lucas Riera was nothing more than a dark smudge struggling against a rising, relentless black tide. The water reached his neck. His face, bathed in Elena's circle of light, was the color of old wax. He wasn't swimming; he floated with the clumsiness of one who has lost the battle against the cold.

"Lucas!" she screamed again, this time tearing her throat.

He raised his head. The movement was slow, agonizing, as if the air weighed as much as the water. His eyes, usually warm and dark, were two wells of glassy confusion. Hypothermia was no longer a threat; it was a sentence being carried out.

Elena swept the perimeter with her flashlight, searching for a ladder, a control panel, anything that wasn't rusted steel and vertical walls. The light illuminated a silhouette at the opposite end of the catwalk, barely ten meters from her.

She froze. Elena's heart, which until that moment had been galloping wildly, skipped a beat and then hung suspended in icy stillness.

The Sculptor.

He stood there, still as a Greek statue. He wore no mask, but shadows sculpted his features so that only a tense jawline and the specular gleam of ice-blue eyes were discernible. He wore an immaculate gray wool coat, an anomaly of elegance in that industrial hell.

Elena raised her service weapon. The weight of the steel in her right hand was the only thing that anchored her to reality.

"Get away from the controls!" she ordered. Her police training tried to take over, but her hands trembled, not from fear, but from the fury burning in her blood.

The man didn't flinch. He didn't raise his hands. He didn't even blink. He simply tilted his head to one side, observing her with the clinical curiosity of an entomologist studying an insect trapped in amber.

"Beauty requires sacrifice, Agent Vives," his voice came clear, projected with perfect diction that cut through the ambient noise. "Cold preserves. Water purifies. He is about to become something eternal."

"Close the damn valve!"

"The choice is yours," he said, gesturing minimally towards the abyss with his gloved hand. "You can pursue me. I have the exit key. Or you can try to get him out before the water level reaches the ceiling. You have..." he glanced at an imaginary watch on his wrist "...less than three minutes before total immersion."

The water below roared, rising another foot. Lucas coughed, a wet, pitiful sound that crawled up the silo walls.

Elena looked at the man. She had a clear shot. She could end the nightmare that had ravaged the valley. She could avenge the frozen girls. But if she shot, if she ran towards him to take the key, Lucas would drown in the darkness.

The Sculptor knew. It was his masterpiece: not a corpse in ice, but Elena's living guilt.

"Son of a bitch," she whispered.

She holstered her pistol with a brusque movement, accepting moral defeat to win the battle for life. The Sculptor gave her one last look, a mix of disappointment and respect, then turned and disappeared through a service door that closed behind him with a definitive metallic *click*.

Elena ran to the railing.

"Hold on!" she roared down into the shaft.

She spotted a maintenance ladder, a structure of iron bars embedded in the concrete, slick with decades of mold. She didn't think twice. She launched herself into the void, clinging to the rungs with a desperation that ignored the pain.

The cold metal bit into the crescent-shaped scar on her left palm, sending a jolt of pain up to her elbow. She ignored it. She descended, jumping three rungs at a time, her boots slipping on the verdigris. The dampness clung to her clothes, heavy and suffocating.

When she reached the water level, the cold struck her like a physical slap. It wasn't just ice water; it was liquid pain, a thousand needles plunging simultaneously into every pore of her skin.

She let go of the ladder and plunged in up to her chest. The impact stole the air from her lungs. She gasped, searching for oxygen, and the taste of oil and metal filled her mouth.

"Lucas!"

He was a few meters away, clinging to a vertical pipe, his chin barely above the black surface. His lips were a bluish, trembling line.

"E-Elena..." The name emerged as a broken whisper.

She swam towards him. Her wet clothes weighed tons, dragging her downwards, but adrenaline was a powerful engine. She reached his side and slipped her arm under his armpits.

The contact was terrifying. Lucas was either burning with fever or so cold his skin scorched; her brain couldn't distinguish the thermal difference.

"I've got you. I've got you, do you hear me? Don't you dare close your eyes."

"My leg..." he mumbled, his head falling onto her shoulder. "Stuck..."

Elena submerged. The murky water was impenetrable to sight, so she had to use touch. Her fingers traced Lucas's thigh, feeling the soaked uniform fabric, until they reached his shin. His foot was wedged between two grates on the chamber floor.

The water continued to rise. It already brushed Elena's chin.

"I'm going to push," she said, surfacing and spitting out water. "On the count of three. You have to pull up. Lucas! Look at me!"

He opened his eyes. There was surrender in them. That stupid, deadly calm that precedes the end.

"No... leave. You won't make it..."

"Shut up!" she yelled at him, and slapped him. The sound was sharp, brutal. Lucas's head snapped back, and some life returned to his gaze, even if it was anger. "You are not leaving me alone with this! One!"

Elena submerged again.

She braced her feet on the grate, found a foothold, and grabbed Lucas's ankle with both hands.

"Two!"

She pulled. She pulled with everything she had, with the rage of the failed case from years ago, with the fear of losing the only person who anchored her to the world, with the brute force of survival.

"THREE!"

She felt Lucas's boot come free with a dull crunch. Perhaps she had broken something, but he was free.

They broke the surface, gasping, coughing water and bile. The water level already covered the lower ventilation grate. Little breathable air remained before the chamber would seal with liquid.

"The ladder..." Elena gasped, dragging Lucas towards the wall.

He tried to help, weakly kicking, but his right leg was dead weight. Elena had to carry almost his entire weight. Every stroke was torture; her muscles burned with lactic acid and the cold began to numb her fingers.

They reached the iron rungs.

"Climb. You have to climb."

"I can't... my hands... I can't feel them."

Elena positioned herself behind him. She pushed his backside, forcing him to grip the first rung.

"Climb or I'll shoot you in the ass myself, Riera. Move!"

Lucas let out a guttural grunt and began the ascent. It was slow, arduous. Elena climbed pressed against him, using her own head and shoulders to support him if he slipped. One step. Another. The sound of water filling the void beneath them transformed into a hungry gurgle, licking at the soles of their boots.

Fifteen meters. A vertical eternity.

When Lucas's hand touched the edge of the upper catwalk, his strength collapsed. He slipped.

Elena reacted purely by instinct. She let go of one hand from the ladder, hanging only by her right, and grabbed Lucas's belt in mid-air. The yank almost dislocated her shoulder. She screamed, a cry that echoed off the concrete dome, but she didn't let go.

Her fingers slipped on the wet leather.

"Up!" she shrieked, and with a final titanic effort, fueled by absolute terror, she hoisted Lucas high enough for him to heave his torso over the metal grate.

He rolled onto the safety of the catwalk, coughing violently. Elena scrambled after him and collapsed onto the cold metal, trembling uncontrollably.

For a minute, there was only the sound of their ragged breaths and the roar of the water below, which finally reached the level of the lower catwalk, engulfing it completely. If they had taken thirty more seconds, they would be dead.

Elena forced herself up. The world spun. She crawled to Lucas.

He was curled into a fetal position, shivering with violent spasms. Elena touched his face. He was icy. He needed urgent warmth, or his heart would go into fibrillation.

"Lucas..." She pulled off his soaked jacket with fumbling hands. He offered no resistance. "We have to move."

"He's gone..." he mumbled, his teeth chattering. "I saw him... up there."

"I know." Elena looked toward the door through which the Sculptor had vanished. It was closed. "I know."

She took off her own parka, which, though damp on the outside, retained some body heat in its inner lining, and threw it over him. Then she took out her multi-tool knife and cut Lucas's pant leg.

His ankle was swollen, purple, and deformed. Probably broken. But that was a problem for later. Now, the problem was hypothermia and the killer on the loose.

Elena stood, swaying. She picked up her pistol from the floor, where it had fallen when she collapsed. She checked the chamber. Dry. Ready.

She walked towards the exit door. She gripped the knob.

She turned it.

Locked.

Of course.

She hit the metal with the butt of her weapon, frustrated. The sound was hollow, mocking.

"Elena..." Lucas's voice was stronger now, fear lending it clarity. "Look at that."

He pointed toward the wall next to the door.

Elena focused her flashlight.

Something was taped to the concrete with industrial adhesive tape. A transparent plastic envelope, hermetically sealed. Inside, a sheet of thick, cream-colored paper.

Elena approached. She tore off the envelope and ripped the plastic.

The handwriting was antique calligraphy, elegant, fountain pen strokes in dark blue ink.

"The true work of art is not death, but transformation. Today you chose life, Agent Vives. You have altered the composition. But every action has an opposite reaction. While we played our game here, nature has taken its course outside. The storm has closed the valley. And I hold the only key to the dam's central heating. Enjoy the winter."

The flashlight flickered once. Twice.

And then, the entire electrical system of the Atrium died.

The roar of the turbines changed pitch. It stopped. The silence that followed was more terrifying than the noise. It wasn't peace; it was the sound of machinery grinding to a halt, of the dam's life support systems shutting down one by one. The darkness was total, dense as tar.

Elena turned her flashlight on again, but the beam seemed weaker now, swallowed by the immensity of the hall. The cold began to descend, no longer from the water, but from the air itself, an invisible claw tightening around her throat.

No heating. No electricity. Wet. Isolated.

Elena turned towards Lucas, illuminating his pale face.

"We haven't won," she whispered, feeling how the real game had just begun. "We've only changed cells."

## Chapter 48: Capítulo 48

**Cavallers Dam, Vall de Boí**
**December 26, 2018**

The sound of the bolt sliding was not a metallic click, but the definitive clang of a judgment.

Elena Vives stood motionless in front of the reinforced steel door, her palm still extended towards the knob that no longer turned. The echo of the lock reverberated against the bare concrete walls of the Atrium, multiplying into a mocking cacophony that took seconds to die. When it did, what remained was not silence. It was an absence of sound so absolute that her own ears began to hum, desperately searching for a frequency that no longer existed.

The darkness was almost total, barely rent by the trembling beam of her tactical flashlight. The air, which seconds before had smelled of stagnant damp, now carried a new, sharp, crystalline nuance: the scent of snow as it hardens.

"Elena!"

Lucas Riera's voice sounded watery, broken by an involuntary chattering of teeth.

She spun on her heels, sweeping the space with the light. The chief of police lay against the walkway railing, his right leg stretched at an unnatural angle. The parka she had lent him was soaked, heavy as a lead slab on his body, but it was the only barrier between his skin and the hypothermia that was already claiming its due.

Elena knelt beside him. There was no hesitation, no time for panic. Her mind, trained in the worst scenarios of human behavior, filed the fear away in a hermetic mental box and focused on the mechanics of survival.

"Don't move," she ordered. Her voice came out hoarse, a cloud of white vapor escaping her lips to dissolve into the darkness. "I need to see that ankle."

Lucas attempted a smile that ended in a grimace of pain. His skin was the color of old wax, and his dark eyes, usually warm, shone with the fever of *shock*.

Elena looked down at his hiking boot. The leather was deformed by internal swelling. She didn't dare unfasten it; the boot's compression was the only thing keeping the joint stable and, likely, containing the internal bleeding.

"The boot stays on," she dictated, running her gloved hands over his shin, searching for exposed fractures. There were none. Lucas let out a muffled groan when she pressed a sensitive spot above his malleolus. "Grade three sprain, or a clean break. Either way, you can't walk."

"I have to. He's out there. Or in here."

"He controls the board, Lucas. We're the pieces he just swept off the table." Elena stood up, illuminating the vast space that opened before them.

The Atrium was an industrial cathedral. Pipes the thickness of a human torso ran along the walls like metallic varicose veins, disappearing into the height of a vault that the flashlight couldn't reach to reveal. Below, in the darkness of the pit, the distant hum of the turbines could be sensed, an underground heartbeat that made the floor vibrate beneath their soles.

It was cold. An aggressive, physical cold that not only lowered skin temperature but seemed to slow thought.

"Do you have the weapon?" Lucas asked, trying to push himself up onto his elbows.

Elena patted her side. The Glock 19 was still in its holster, a comforting weight but useless against the invisible enemy that now stalked them: the sub-zero temperatures.

"I have the weapon. I have your phone, but down here it's an inert brick. And we have..." She looked at her wrist watch, her father's old analog one. The hands glowed faintly. "Perhaps three hours before your core temperature drops to critical levels. We need heat."

"The control room... there must be... an emergency panel."

"Stay here. And for heaven's sake, try not to fall asleep."

Elena walked away. Her footsteps echoed with an obscene clarity on the metal walkway. Every meter that separated her from Lucas increased the pressure in her chest, that old claw of anxiety that constricted her throat in confined spaces. *Breathe. Analyze. Execute.*

She followed the luminous path to a fuse box attached to a load-bearing pillar. The lid was open. As she illuminated the interior, Elena felt a nausea that had nothing to do with the cold.

It wasn't a short circuit. The wires hadn't been burned by an overload. They had been extracted. Not cut, but unscrewed with surgical precision and removed. The empty sockets where the heating relays should have been looked like empty eye sockets staring at her.

"Damn son of a bitch!" she whispered.

The Sculptor didn't improvise. This wasn't a reaction to their arrival; it was a prepared scenario. He had turned the dam into a giant refrigerator, patiently waiting for the meat to enter to be preserved.

She continued her walk along the platform, circling the Atrium's circular perimeter. The structure was labyrinthine. She passed rusted valves and pressure gauges whose glass was fogged with frost that was beginning to form inside.

Then she saw it.

At the end of the corridor, a half-open door cast a faint, almost imperceptible line of light onto the gridded floor. It wasn't conventional electric light. It was a bluish, chemical glow.

Elena drew her weapon. The metal of the pistol burned with cold. She advanced close to the wall, controlling her breathing so that her vapor wouldn't betray her position before her body did.

She peered into the doorway.

No one was there. The room was an old maintenance office, now stripped of any useful furniture. In the center, on a plastic folding chair, rested an LED camping lamp, the source of that spectral light.

And next to the lamp, a sheet of paper.

Elena entered, sweeping the corners with the barrel of her weapon. Clear. She approached the chair. The paper was a thick, high-quality sheet, artistic in its incongruity in that environment of grease and metal.

A sentence was written in impeccable, almost architectural calligraphy, in black ink:

"Beauty is only eternal if time stands still. Welcome to my museum."

Below the note, there was a small object. Elena illuminated it. It was an industrial digital thermometer, of the kind used to calibrate turbines. The red numbers blinked, descending with hypnotic speed.

*—8 °C.*
*—8.5 °C.*

Elena frowned. The outside temperature was low, but the dam's insulation should keep the interior above freezing thanks to the thermal inertia of the concrete and water. Unless...

A dull hum began to emanate from the ventilation grates in the ceiling. It wasn't the sound of the heating starting. It was a constant, dry blow. Elena took off a glove and raised her hand towards the duct.

The air coming out wasn't recirculating the environment. It was a direct injection of polar air, forced from outside and, possibly, cooled even further by some inverted heat exchange system.

The Sculptor hadn't just turned off the heating. He had turned the ventilation system into a rapid-freeze weapon.

"Elena!"

Lucas's urgent cry tore her from her analysis.

She ran back along the walkway, ignoring the burning in her lungs as she inhaled the icy air. Her flashlight's beam danced chaotically on the curved walls.

When she reached Lucas's position, she found him trying to drag himself backward, away from the railing.

"What's wrong?" Elena knelt, pointing towards where he was looking.

Lucas pointed down, into the dark pit of the Atrium.

"Listen!" he said, his voice trembling violently. "The water."

Elena strained her ears. The hum of the turbines had changed. It was no longer a constant drone. Now there was a gurgling, a liquid and rising sound.

She leaned over the railing, illuminating the void. The light beam was lost in the depth, but something reflected it back: a black, oily surface, agitated.

"He's opened the bottom valves," Elena realized, feeling the blood drain from her face. "He's flooding the lower chamber to increase humidity."

"Humidity and extreme cold," Lucas murmured, understanding the elemental physics of death. "He's going to turn us into ice."

Elena looked at her companion. Frost was already beginning to glisten on the police officer's eyelashes. The pain in his leg, the bone-chilling cold, the water level rising like a black tide... everything was designed to induce despair.

"Get up!" she said, pulling his good arm with a strength she didn't know she still had. "We have to get to the crest level. Now!"

"I can't..."

"I said get up!" she yelled, her voice breaking the deadly calm of the enclosure. Her green eyes, usually analytical and distant, burned with a primitive fury. "I'm not going to let you become part of his damned collection."

Lucas nodded, gritting his teeth until his jaw ached. He leaned on her, shifting his full weight onto Elena's left shoulder. She stumbled for an instant, readjusting her center of gravity, assuming both the physical and emotional burden.

Together, they formed a clumsy, limping silhouette under the bluish light filtering from the office, advancing towards the service stairs while the digital thermometer, forgotten on the chair, marked a new descent.

*—10 °C.*

And the water kept rising.

## Chapter 49: Capítulo 49

The concrete corridor descended into the mountain's depths, an artificial throat that swallowed the sound of the storm outside. Down here, the wind's howl had been replaced by an electrical hum, low and constant, like the heartbeat of a dying animal.

Elena Vives moved forward, pressed against the left wall, feeling the rough, cold cement through her gloves. Her breath condensed into ephemeral clouds that the flickering fluorescent light tinted gray. Behind her, the irregular rhythm of footsteps betrayed Lucas Riera's effort. The police chief dragged his right leg; the pain from his old injury, exacerbated by the humidity and drop in barometric pressure, must have been torture, but he hadn't uttered a single complaint.

"Not much further," Elena whispered, not so much to inform as to convince herself.

She checked her father's watch. The analog face showed three in the morning, though in that bunker, time seemed to have dissolved. The second hand advanced with cruel indifference.

"It smells like him," Lucas growled. His voice was raspy, laden with fatigue.

He was right. The air, until then stale with mold and subterranean dampness, began to permeate with a clinical scent. Menthol and industrial disinfectant. A pristine smell that, in that context of darkness and danger, was more nauseating than rot. It was the olfactory signature of the Sculptor.

They reached a fork. The main corridor ended at a reinforced steel door, hermetically sealed. To the right, a gutted control panel showed colorful wires like exposed veins.

Elena approached the mechanism. Her numb fingers traced the path of the wires.

"It's an airlock system," she declared, her profiler's mind switching to analytical mode to quell the apprehension crawling up her stomach. "It needs a code or a physical key."

Lucas leaned against the wall, taking weight off his bad leg. He clutched his service weapon with calloused hands, knuckles white with tension.

"Or a bit of brute persuasion," he said, pointing at the rusted hinges. "Arnald isn't an engineer. He adapted this old mine, but the structure is giving way."

Before they could decide on a method, a metallic click resonated above their heads. The speakers, hidden somewhere in the vaulted ceiling, came alive with a hiss of static.

"Impatience is a flaw of living flesh," Dr. Arnald Soler's voice filled the corridor, amplified and devoid of any human warmth. "Perfection requires pause. It requires... stillness."

Elena felt the hairs on the back of her neck bristle. It wasn't a recording. He was watching them.

"Soler!" Lucas shouted, pointing his weapon at the security camera that blinked with a red light in the upper corner. "It's over! Come out with your hands up."

A soft laugh, dry as dead leaves, emanated from the speakers.

"Lucas, always so predictable. So... dynamic. But your role in this play has concluded."

The floor beneath their feet vibrated. It wasn't an earthquake, but the activation of heavy machinery. A security barrier, a thick sheet of metal that had been hidden in the ceiling, began to descend rapidly between them, separating Elena and the police officer.

"Lucas!" Elena lunged forward, but instinct stopped her mere inches from the falling steel guillotine.

"Get back, Elena!" he roared.

The clang of metal hitting concrete sealed the corridor. The echo of the impact reverberated in Elena's chest, leaving her in utter and complete silence. She was alone on the isolated side. Lucas had been left behind.

"No..." she gasped, striking the cold surface with her open palm, the crescent-shaped scar on her left hand burning from the impact.

"Solitude sharpens the senses, doesn't it, Elena?" Arnald's voice returned, now more intimate, as if whispering directly into her ear. "He was a hindrance. A chaotic variable. You and I share the search for truth. Come. The Sanctuary is open for you."

The electronic lock on the door in front of her emitted a sharp beep and the red light changed to green. The mechanism released with a hydraulic sigh.

Elena looked back at the barrier separating her from her ally. A wave of panic, that old shadow that had haunted her since her last failed case, tried to close its grip around her throat. She felt the pressure in her chest, the lack of air, the certainty that she was trapped in a tomb of ice and metal. *Emotional claustrophobia*.

"Order in chaos," she repeated mentally. "Analyze. Execute."

Lucas was injured, yes. But Lucas Riera was the immovable force of Aigüestortes. If Arnald thought a metal door would stop the man who had carried the weight of an entire valley for years, he didn't know him.

Elena couldn't wait. If she entered the Sculptor's game, if she advanced alone into the trap, she would die. And Lucas would die trying to save her. She had to change the rules.

She ignored the open door that invited her into the wolf's den. Instead, she rummaged in her pockets. She pulled out the small tactical flashlight she had taken from the supply kit and, instead of lighting the way, used it as a hammer. She struck the exposed fuse box next to the airlock panel.

One, two, three dry strikes. The plastic shattered. Blue sparks flew, illuminating her moss-green eyes.

"Come on, Lucas," she whispered, her voice broken by tension. "I know you're there."

On the other side of the metal wall, a muffled thud was heard. Then another. A rhythmic, brutal sound. Metal against metal.

"Elena!" Lucas's voice, though muffled, resonated with firmness. "Get away from the door!"

She ran to the opposite end of the narrow corridor, covering her head.

There was a contained boom. Not an explosion, but the sound of physics yielding to brute force. Lucas must have shot at the hinges or used some heavy industrial object to pry open the damaged mechanism.

With a blood-curdling screech, the metal sheet buckled at the bottom. Large hands, fingers stained with grease and blood, appeared through the gap, grabbing the bottom edge.

Elena saw the muscles of Lucas's forearms tense beneath the fabric of his uniform. With a roar of effort that mingled pain and fury, the police officer lifted the barrier just enough, wedging it open with a piece of pipe he had ripped from the wall.

He squeezed through the opening, falling to his knees on the other side, beside her. He was breathing heavily, sweat beading on his forehead, mixing with the gray dust of the bunker. His right leg trembled visibly, unable to support him for a moment.

Elena knelt beside him, gripping his shoulders.

"I thought..." she began, but the words caught in her throat.

Lucas looked up. His dark, usually tired eyes now burned with fierce determination. He wiped the back of his hand across his mouth, cleaning away a trickle of blood.

"That bastard..." Lucas gasped, forcing himself to his feet, using Elena as momentary support until he regained his balance. "He underestimated me. He thinks I'm an old cripple."

"You *are* an old cripple," Elena said, and for the first time in hours, a fleeting, nervous smile crossed her face. "But you're my old cripple."

Lucas reloaded his weapon with a dry motion. The 'clack-clack' of the slide sounded like a death knell.

"Arnald made a mistake," he said, looking at the open door at the end of the corridor, that dark maw leading to the laboratory. "He wanted to divide us. Now he has both of us, and I'm really pissed off."

The Sculptor's voice was no longer coming from the speakers. Silence had returned, but now it was different. It wasn't the stillness of observation, but the tension before an assault. Arnald knew they had bypassed his first filter. The final match had begun.

Elena stood up, dusting off her pants. Her gaze hardened. Fear was still there, an unwanted passenger in her stomach, but Lucas's solid presence beside her acted as an anchor.

They advanced together towards the threshold. The smell of mint became more intense, almost unbearable, mixing with the low temperature emanating from the adjoining room. It was an unnatural, chemical cold, designed to halt life in a perfect instant.

They stopped in front of the door frame. Elena looked at Lucas and nodded once. Lucas returned the gesture, adjusting his grip on his pistol.

There was no need for words. They were going to enter the frozen hell, but they would enter standing and together. Elena extended her hand and pushed the steel sheet.

## Chapter 50: Capítulo 50

The air inside the Cavallers dam lacked the purity of the mountains; it tasted of rust, stale hydraulic oil, and an artificial cold born not of winter, but of chemistry. Elena Vives felt her breath freeze on her lips before she could even exhale. They were in the belly of the concrete beast, an abandoned auxiliary turbine room that Doctor Arnald Soler had transformed into his final operating theater.

There were no natural stalactites here, only pressure-burst pipes hanging from the steel girders like metallic intestines, dripping a coolant liquid that hissed upon touching the polished concrete floor. The fluorescent lights flickered, casting spasmodic shadows onto the gray walls, stained with dampness and years of structural neglect.

“Art requires permanence, Elena,” Arnald’s voice echoed in the metallic acoustics of the chamber.

The Sculptor stood by the floodgate controls, but his attention wasn't on the water contained behind the wall, but on the industrial cryogenic tank situated in the center of the room. His eyes, that inexpressive blue Elena had mistaken for clinical serenity, now glowed with the fever of culmination. The scent of antiseptic and mint emanating from him managed to overpower even the stench of old grease from the machinery.

Lucas Riera moved to Elena’s right. The police chief dragged his leg; the pain in his knee must have been a constant scream in that glacial environment, but his large, calloused hands held his service weapon with a firmness that belied his exhaustion.

“It’s over, Arnald,” Lucas growled. His voice was raspy, laden with the fatigue of three days of pursuit. “There’s no way out. The maintenance tunnels are blocked.”

“Way out?” Arnald smiled, a neat gesture that didn’t reach his eyes. “I’m not looking to flee, Lucas. I’m looking to preserve.”

The doctor raised a hand, revealing a remote detonator. It wasn’t connected to conventional explosives, but to the pressure valves of the massive refrigeration system feeding the tank.

Elena analyzed the surroundings with the speed of someone who had spent years studying ice fractures. But this wasn’t glacial ice; it was human engineering pushed to its limit. The concrete vault above their heads showed fine cracks, dark capillaries in the artificial stone caused by the vibrations of the external storm and internal thermal stress.

“If you open those valves abruptly,” Elena said, keeping her tone low, clinical, trying to appeal to the logic of the man of science Arnald believed himself to be, “thermal expansion will shatter the foundations. You won’t preserve anything. This room will become a tomb of rubble, not a museum.”

Arnald tilted his head, as if considering an interesting diagnosis.

“Destruction is merely a phase of transformation.”

The doctor’s finger tensed on the button.

“Now!” Lucas yelled.

The police officer lunged forward, ignoring the protest of his injured leg, trying to close the distance. Arnald reacted with surprising speed, retreating to the cover of the main tank as he pressed the detonator.

A deafening hiss filled the concrete chamber. There was no fire, only a dense, white cloud of liquid nitrogen that erupted from the auxiliary valves, devouring oxygen and temperature in micro-seconds.

Elena felt the bite of absolute cold on the exposed skin of her face. Her lungs constricted. She saw Lucas stumble as the floor beneath his boots instantly coated with a layer of slippery frost. Arnald, protected by his position behind the tank and a mask he had donned with practiced movements, prepared to fire at the fallen officer.

Time fractured in Elena’s mind. She couldn’t reach Lucas. She couldn’t disarm Arnald. Her moss-green gaze locked onto the industrial structure’s only vulnerable point: the main injector of the nitrogen tank, a chrome-steel pipe vibrating under unstable pressure.

*Order in chaos.*

She raised the weapon she had taken from the body of a fallen agent in the upper tunnels. Her hands didn’t tremble; fear had sublimated into a geometric clarity. She aimed not at the man, but at the machine.

The shot thundered in the confined space, sounding more like a hammer blow against an anvil than a detonation.

The bullet pierced the injector.

The result wasn’t an explosion, but an implosion of temperature. The tank tore open with the shriek of tortured metal. A geyser of white vapor, nearly two hundred degrees below zero, shot out with the force of a hydraulic cannon, striking directly against the load-bearing girders supporting the room’s ceiling.

The steel, subjected to an impossible thermal shock, screamed. The main girders snapped with a crash that vibrated Elena’s dental fillings.

“Lucas, take cover!” she roared, diving behind a rusted turbine.

The concrete vault, deprived of its support and cracked by the sudden contraction of the cold, gave way.

It wasn’t a gradual collapse. It was a total collapse. Vehicle-sized concrete blocks detached from the ceiling, dragging electrical wiring networks and ventilation ducts with them. Construction dust mixed with the nitrogen mist, creating a white and gray blindness.

Arnald Soler screamed. It wasn’t a scream of pain, but of fury at seeing his masterpiece interrupted. He tried to run towards the service exit, but the floor beneath his feet fractured. A section of the elevated walkway, made of metal grating and safety railings, twisted as if it were soft wire under the impact of a slab of reinforced concrete.

Elena curled into a fetal position, covering her head as the world came crashing down. She felt the impact of debris bouncing off her back, dust filling her mouth, the coppery taste of fear on her tongue. The noise was apocalyptic: the roar of stone breaking, the lament of metal, and, in the background, the distant but growing rumble of the dam's water pressing against walls that had just lost their internal structural integrity.

Then, silence. A dense, heavy stillness, broken only by the dripping of some surviving pipe and the settling of the debris.

Elena coughed, expelling plaster and cement dust from her airways. Her ears rang. She forced herself to open her eyes. Visibility was almost nil, a milky gloom barely illuminated by the sparks of a torn cable swinging like a macabre pendulum.

“Lucas?” Her voice came out broken, barely a whisper.

“I’m… here.”

The answer came from her left, muffled but alive. Elena crawled over the debris, ignoring the sharp pain in her knees and the cut on her cheek. She found Lucas half-buried under a sheet of thermal insulation and gravel, but the heavy concrete had fallen just inches from him, forming a triangle of survival thanks to the fallen turbine.

She helped him free himself, her fingers frantically searching for any sign of critical damage. Lucas grunted as he moved his injured leg, but nodded.

“I’m alright. Just bruised.”

Both turned towards where Arnald had been.

There was no longer a tank, no control platform, no floor. Instead, a mountain of twisted girders, fractured concrete slabs, and shattered pipes rose to the ruined ceiling. From amidst the debris, a cold smoke emanated, the last breath of the nitrogen dissipating.

At the base of the collapse, trapped beneath an I-beam and tons of masonry, something gleamed. It was a metallic reflection, pristine, out of place amidst so much dirty destruction.

They approached, limping, breathing with difficulty the rarefied air.

Beneath the mountain of industrial ruins, only one hand was visible. Pale, immaculate, with fingers outstretched as if trying to reach for something. Arnald’s wristwatch continued ticking away the seconds with indifferent precision. The rest of the Sculptor had become fused with the concrete and ice, buried forever in the foundations of the dam he had intended to use as a sanctuary.

Elena looked at the inert hand. She felt no triumph, only a sudden emptiness, as if adrenaline had been drained from her with a syringe. The crescent-shaped scar on her left palm throbbed with the rhythm of her heart.

“It’s over,” Lucas said, his grave voice echoing in the new artificial cavern they had created.

Elena nodded, but her green eyes continued to scan the structure above them.

“The dam is compromised,” she stated, observing a new crack seeping black water on the far wall. “We have to get out. Now.”

The distant roar of water seeking an exit confirmed her analysis. Arnald’s tomb would soon become an underwater grave.

Lucas leaned on Elena’s shoulder. She bore his weight, accepting the physical burden as the only tangible reality in that moment. Together, they turned their backs on the remains of the concrete operating theater and began the arduous ascent to the surface, leaving behind the man who had wanted to freeze time and who was now, ironically, a static part of the architecture.

## Epilogue: Epílogo

**Vielha Hospital, Aran Valley**
**February 14th, one month later**

The smell of disinfectant never quite managed to cover the stale aroma of illness. Elena Vives walked down the third-floor corridor, counting the white tiles, a nervous habit that had survived the storm. 112 steps from the elevator to room 304. Her boots, still caked with dried mud from the thaw, squeaked faintly on the polished linoleum, breaking the aseptic silence of the sanatorium.

She stopped in front of the half-open door. Her left hand, where the crescent-shaped scar throbbed with changes in atmospheric pressure, hesitated over the metal doorknob. Through the glass, the grayish light of a winter afternoon bathed the room.

She pushed the wooden door open.

Lucas Riera was not in bed. The police chief sat in a wheelchair by the window, his right leg in a cast and elevated on a footrest. The light silhouetted his broad frame, now somewhat thinner, accentuating the premature gray hairs at his temples. He looked like a statue weathered by the elements, a monument to exhaustion.

"You shouldn't be up," said Elena. Her voice sounded raspy, as if she hadn't used it in days.

Lucas slowly turned his head. His brown eyes, sunken in sockets darkened by lack of sleep, scrutinized her. There was no reproach in his gaze, only mutual recognition, the silent greeting of two shipwreck survivors.

"The nurses say if I don't move, I'll rust," he replied, managing a half-smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. "And the bed reminds me too much of a slab."

Elena closed the door behind her, shutting out the distant bustle from the nurses' station. She approached the window, keeping a respectful distance, honoring the magnetic field of pain that surrounded the police officer.

"The final forensic report came in this morning," she commented, looking outside. "The mountain peaks, once relentless devourers, now rose indifferently under a leaden sky. They've identified all the remains. Even those that had been under the permafrost for decades."

Lucas nodded, drumming his calloused fingers on the armrest of his chair.

"The thaw always gives back what we lend it," he murmured in a low voice. "The valley has a memory, Elena. More than we do."

"Arnald..." she began, but the word caught in her throat. Her mentor's name, now stained by the shadow of suspicion and tragedy, weighed like a stone in her stomach. "They confirmed his fall wasn't accidental. He knew what he was doing, aware it was the only way to stop the machinery."

"Sometimes, cutting the rope is the only way to keep others from falling into the void," Lucas stated. He rubbed his right thigh just above the cast, a reflex gesture against a phantom pain. "Down here, people are starting to forget. They clear the snow from the sidewalks, open the shops, prepare for the spring season. It's obscene how quickly life covers death."

Elena turned to face him. The fading light caught her asymmetrical bob cut, revealing new lines of expression around her moss-green eyes.

"It's not forgetting, Lucas. It's survival. The same survival that made you drag yourself two kilometers with a shattered tibia to call for help."

He averted his gaze, uncomfortable with the implicit praise. He fumbled in the pocket of his hospital gown, searching for something clumsily.

"I almost forgot. One of the rescue teams found this near the cave entrance, where the snow had receded."

He extended his hand. In his open, large, and rough palm rested a metallic object.

Elena's heart skipped a beat. It was her father's analog watch. The leather strap was darkened by moisture, and the crystal had a diagonal crack splitting the face in two, separating twelve from six.

She took it reverently, as if it were a sacred relic. The metal was cold, but as she brought it to her ear, she heard the faint, rhythmic *tick-tock*.

"It's still working," she whispered, feeling a knot in her throat that threatened to unravel her analytical composure.

"It's old machinery," said Lucas, observing her with an intensity that made her feel vulnerable. "The kind that was made to last, to withstand blows and keep ticking. Like you."

Elena buckled the watch onto her wrist. The familiar weight on her arm acted as an anchor, stabilizing the vertigo she'd felt since leaving the cave. The crack in the crystal didn't prevent her from seeing the time; it only reminded her that time, from now on, would be marked.

"I'm being discharged tomorrow," Lucas announced, breaking the spell. "I suppose you'll go back to Madrid. Your glaciology thesis must be waiting for you, and I doubt you'll want to see snow for a while."

There was a dense silence. Elena looked out the window again. Below, in the parking lot, cars were splashes of color on the gray asphalt. Beyond, the road snaked towards the tunnel, the exit mouth to civilization, to noisy cafes, incessant traffic, and the anonymity of the big city. Towards a life where ice only existed as cubes in a glass.

But then she looked up at the summits. The imposing peaks, which before had seemed like relentless devourers, now stood immutable under a leaden sky. She no longer saw monsters on their slopes. In her mind, tectonic plates, freezing cycles, cracks that needed to be measured and understood, took shape. She understood the natural chaos that had so terrified her and that, paradoxically, was the only thing that now felt honest to her.

"No," she said, with a clarity that surprised her.

"What?"

"I've requested my records be transferred to the Aran Valley monitoring station. They need someone to oversee the residual glaciers. Someone who understands how ice moves from within."

Lucas frowned, incredulous. "Elena, this place almost killed you. This is where your ghosts are."

"My ghosts go with me wherever I go, Lucas. In Madrid, they hide in the corners of my apartment, in the subway's noise. Here, at least, they have space to run." She leaned on the windowsill, crossing her arms. "Besides, someone has to make sure the snow doesn't cover what it shouldn't again."

The police chief watched her for a long time. He searched her green eyes for any trace of madness or unresolved trauma, but found only a quiet determination, solid as bedrock.

"You're staying," he repeated, not as a question, but tasting the affirmation.

"I'm staying."

Lucas nodded slowly. The tension in his shoulders seemed to dissipate, as if he had just released an invisible burden he hadn't known he was carrying.

"Then I suppose we'll see each other. Aigüestortes is a small town."

"I suppose so." Elena managed a faint smile, her first real one in a month. "And you're going to need someone to help you with rehabilitation if you want to patrol those trails again."

"I have a physio assigned," he countered, though the twinkle in his eyes belied his defensive tone.

"Your physio doesn't know a safe crevice from a death trap. I do."

They looked at each other, and in that exchange there were no words of love or eternal promises, only the understanding of two broken pieces that, when joined, formed something different, imperfect but functional. An alliance forged in absolute cold.

Elena stepped away from the window and walked towards the door. Before leaving, she stopped and looked at her father's watch. The hands kept moving, indifferent to the past, devouring the future second by second.

"Rest, Lucas," she said without turning. "Winter is ending, but the mountain is still there."

She stepped into the corridor. The hospital air no longer felt so suffocating. At the end of the hall, the automatic doors opened, letting in a gust of icy wind. Elena did not shiver. She inhaled deeply, filling her lungs with the sharp evening air, and walked outside.

The snow at the edges of the road was melting, turning into dirty water that ran towards the gutters. But high up, on the summits, the white remained pristine, eternal, waiting. There was no more fear. Only a deep and silent respect. Peace was not the absence of storm, she understood as she walked towards her car; peace was the certainty that, when the storm returned, she would be ready to read the signs in the ice.
