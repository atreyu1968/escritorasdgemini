# Las Estrellas del Peregrino (Copia)

## CHAPTER 0: Prologue

Pumice rasped a dry hiss against the parchment, like the slithering drag of an unseen viper. In the solitude of the scriptorium, under the barrel-vaulted ceiling that barely held back the damp chill of the Galician night, that was the only sound vying with the tempest outside. The tendons in Brother Giraldo's right hand, knotted by arthritis and terror, taut, threatened to tear. It wasn't enough. The iron-gall ink, black as the very maw of hell, clung to the parchment's fibers, as ingrained as the stain of original sin.

Giraldo halted the frantic motion of his wrist. His breath, ragged and steamy in the frigid air, fogged the dying flame of the tallow lamp, which, already weak, threatened to gutter out. He gazed at the folio. It was no canonical text. These were not apostolic words sanctioned by Rome, nor the glosses of the Church Fathers his brethren copied during daylight hours. Those lines, brought from the deserts of the East and translated in secret, cloaked by shadows, spoke of a truth Archbishop Gelmírez would immolate along with its bearer.

The Church taught men to cast their eyes to the ground, to the humility of the earth. This text, however, compelled one to look up, not to the promised Heaven, but to the mathematical abyss of the firmament. It was the Gospel of Stars. A treatise that whispered divine will was a distant echo, and the relentless mechanics of the cosmos the true weaver of destinies. Should that knowledge escape Compostela's walls, should Christendom learn that nebulae dictated the fortunes of kings and that God was an impassive creator, the very foundations of faith would crack faster than dried mud beneath the summer sun.

A dull thud shattered his paralysis.

It wasn't thunder, though the storm lashed the city with primordial fury. It was something closer. Heavier. The oak of the spiral staircase, three floors below, had groaned.

A slab of granite seemed to settle upon his ribs, crushing the breath from him. Giraldo knew who ascended. No one else wandered the unfinished cathedral at such an hour. The master stonemasons slept in their barracks; the novices dreamed in their cells. Only he, the librarian with the iron key dangling from his belt, and *him*. The Shadow. The Stellifer.

Giraldo assailed the parchment again, this time with the blind fury of a trapped beast. The bone scraper gouged the membrane, tearing a corner.

“Damn it!” he rasped, and the word boomed in the empty chamber's unforgiving acoustics.

Another step. Closer this time. The creak of ancient timber rose like a dense wave of fear. Whoever it was, they were in no hurry. Death, he thought, never rushes when it knows itself unavoidable; it advances, step by measured step, with the certainty of cornered prey.

The old man released the tool. His fingers, smeared with soot and ink, trembled with such force he nearly knocked over the horn inkwell. He couldn't erase it. There was no time to cleanse the page and restore it to its pristine white. He had to conceal it. But the scriptorium was a place of order, of open shelves and bare lecterns. Anything out of place would be discovered by the guardians of dogma before the cock crowed.

His gaze, watery and clouded by cataracts, swept the dim chamber. The shadows of the columns capered on the walls, mocking him like hungry specters. Then, his eyes seized upon the far end of the hall, where the work of the new nave merged with the temporary library.

The altarpiece.

It was a structure of wood and stone, still ungilded, destined for a side chapel that the master builders had only just begun to raise. Giraldo knew its secrets because he himself had designed the iconography. He knew that behind the carved figure of an angel with the trumpet of Judgment, the wood was not solid. There was a miscalculation, a small hollow born of a knot in the oak which the carpenter had chosen to overlook rather than waste the fine timber.

The steps were now on the final flight. The sound of heavy boots, metal-studded soles, scraped against the stone of the outer corridor. *Clack. Clack. Clack.* A metronome ticking off the remaining seconds of life.

Giraldo rose. His knees groaned, a painful protest from his worn joints. He clutched the accursed folio. The parchment felt cold to the touch, almost oily. He folded it clumsily, heedless of the fresh ink staining his fingertips, marking him an accomplice to heresy.

He shuffled towards the altarpiece, dragging his leather sandals across the uneven flagstones. Every step felt like an eternity. The air smelled of ozone and wet stone, an electric fusion that prickled the hairs on his neck. Reaching the angel's carving, he murmured a prayer addressed not to any known saint, but to the mute forces that governed tides and winds.

“Guard this truth!” he pleaded, his voice ragged.

He slipped his fingers into the crack behind the wooden wing. A splinter bit into his flesh, but he drove the rolled paper deep into the void's darkness, where only spiders and dust would have dominion for centuries. The parchment vanished into the core of sacred art. It was a perfect irony: the Western world's gravest heresy, reposing within the very heart of its most devout iconography.

He wiped his hands on his rough woolen habit, leaving dark smudges that blurred with years of ingrained grime. He staggered back two paces, gasping. His heart hammered against his ribs, an unbridled drum in the confines of his chest.

The knob of the oak door turned.

The sound was slow, metallic, the shriek of a mechanism decades without grease. Giraldo spun toward the entrance, seeking something, anything that could serve as a weapon. He saw only the blunt-tipped stylus on his work table, five meters away. Too far. Too useless.

The wooden leaf swung open with a crash, striking the stone wall with a boom that rattled the monk's teeth.

Wind surged into the room, extinguishing the lamp instantly. A darkness absolute, dense and utter, engulfed the scriptorium, broken only by lightning bolts exploding beyond the narrow window slits, silhouetting a form in the doorway.

It was immense. A figure swathed in a soaked travel cloak that dripped onto the floor, forming pools of black water. Its face remained unseen, hidden beneath a deep cowl, but Giraldo didn't need to see its eyes to feel its oppressive presence. It radiated a chill unrelated to the winter's bite; it was the cold of the void, of the spaces between stars where God's gaze did not reach.

The Stellifer stepped inside.

“Giraldo,” said the voice. It was neither a shout nor a whisper. It was a flat, toneless utterance, devoid of human inflection, like the grind of two millstones rubbing together. “You have been reading what must not be read.”

The monk recoiled until he struck the edge of the lectern. He clutched the wood to stay upright.

“Knowledge…” Giraldo tried to articulate, but his throat clamped shut, dry as a tormented soul's ossuary. “Knowledge cannot be sin.”

“Curiosity mothers heresy,” the figure replied, advancing. Water from its cloak left a glistening trail as lightning illuminated the chamber. “And heresy is a disease. I am the surgeon.”

The intruder raised a hand. A silver flash gleamed briefly: a misericorde, slender and precise, designed to slip between ribs without fracturing bone.

Giraldo's mind flew to the hollow behind the angel, to the words on that parchment, to the charts of a forbidden sky that defied scripture. *They are safe*, he thought, and an odd stillness settled over him, numbing his dread. He had fulfilled his purpose. He was a guardian, and his watch had ended.

“You won't find it,” the monk stated, with a resolve that surprised even himself.

The Stellifer paused a step away. The scent of wet leather and rusted metal assailed Giraldo's nostrils.

“Flesh speaks, Brother,” said the Shadow. “It always speaks before falling silent forever.”

The killer's arm flashed, a swift blur. Giraldo felt no pain at first, only a blunt impact, then a rush of heat spreading through his belly. His legs gave way. He dropped to his knees, eyes fixed on his executioner's studded boots.

As the chamber's gloom merged with the darkness blossoming within his own eyes, Brother Giraldo smiled. Blood stained the stone floor, but the ink was dry and hidden. The Gospel of Stars slumbered. And one day, someone with eyes to see would awaken the truth.

The Stellifer stooped over the dying form, searching for answers that would no longer come. Outside, thunder swallowed the monk's last breath, sealing the silence over Santiago's scriptorium.

## CHAPTER 1: The Dust of Ages

The drone of rain against the Cathedral’s lead roofs crafted a muted, watery world, cutting off the scaffolding from everything else. Thirty feet up, the damp was more than just weather; it was a physical weight that permeated his clothes and chilled him to the bone. The air carried the scent of stale wax, of centuries of burnt incense, and that unique mineral tang granite released as it wept moisture.

The tip of his number three scalpel teased at the surface with surgical finesse. There, in the folds of Prophet Daniel’s robe, eight centuries of grime had formed a dark, tenacious crust, hard as the most unyielding ore, completely obscuring the original polychromy.

To anyone else, the painstaking task of cleaning the stone smiles of the Pórtico de la Gloria would have been an agonizing ordeal. For Elías, perched on the metal platform, this solitude offered a singular peace, clinging to him as stubbornly as sweat to his skin.

Elías Varela nudged his thick-framed spectacles with the back of his hand, careful not to smear the lenses with his latex-gloved fingers. His breath faintly steamed the glass, forcing him to pause and regulate his lungs’ rhythm. The world of the living, with its unpredictable chaos and noisy chatter, lay far below. Down in the central nave, tourists milled about, oblivious, like disoriented ants beneath the vault’s vastness. Up here, only Master Mateo’s immutable logic held sway: stone upon stone, order, truth.

He resumed his work. The steel blade slipped beneath a layer of calcified lichen.

"Careful," he whispered, his voice barely a hiss that the vault refused to return. "Respect."

He applied the barest pressure to the point where the robe’s fold met the central pillar. Without warning, the material’s resistance shifted. There was none of the usual grit of metal against quartz.

*Crack.*

The sound was dry, organic.

The instrument’s tip sank into what had seemed a solid vein of the trumeau. Elías froze instantly, his forearm muscles taut. He withdrew the tool slowly, dreading that he had marred the Romanesque masterpiece.

The sight stole his breath.

A triangular fragment, camouflaged with astounding skill to mimic the surrounding granite’s texture, had slid inward. It wasn't rock; it was wood. Old, parched, painted with a mix of lime and mica dust to deceive the eye. As it yielded, the fragment disclosed utter blackness. A rectangular void barely five centimeters wide, carved deep into the pillar, right behind the smiling prophet’s knee.

Elías’s heart began to hammer against his ribs, an erratic drumbeat echoing in his ears. He cast a swift glance around. Below, the visitors’ murmur carried on undisturbed. No one looked up. He was alone in his aerie.

Professional ethics, etched into his mind after decades of scrupulous academia, screamed a clear command: “Stop. Document. Call the restoration director.” Yet his disobedient fingers pressed on. It was curiosity, that intimate bite that has driven wiser men to ruin, that propelled him.

He angled his headlamp towards the aperture. The beam of light sliced through the niche’s gloom and exposed something that did not belong to the cathedral’s architecture. It wasn’t rubble, nor was it mouse nests. It was a cylinder.

It was made of leather, so darkened by time and oxidation that it almost blended with the shadows. The surface was cracked, looking like sickly hide poised to disintegrate.

Elías set the scalpel down on the tool tray. His hands, usually steady, betrayed an imperceptible tremor. He peeled off his right glove. He needed touch, the rough truth of matter beneath his fingers.

The pad of his middle finger, stained by that perpetual inkblot, his personal stigma, brushed the object’s edge.

It was dry. Fragile.

He pinched it with extreme delicacy and pulled. The cylinder offered faint resistance, a soft, voiceless groan, as if the cathedral itself refused to yield its secret. Then it slid free, accompanied by a shower of fine particles, remnants of a forgotten era.

He held it in his palm. It weighed less than it looked.

The leather was sealed with a wax plug that had long lost any identifying mark, now just an amorphous blob.

“What are you?” he asked the stale air.

Logic, cold and measured, told him it could only be a minor relic; perhaps a prayer from a superstitious 12th-century stonemason, immured as an offering. But the spot... no. The location was far too prominent for such a trifle.

The trumeau was the axis of the world in Jacobean iconography. No one concealed a triviality in the heart of Glory.

With his thumbnail, he pried off the wax plug. The snap was obscenely loud in the stillness of the heights.

The edge of a parchment peeked from inside. He recognized the high-quality vellum at once by its cream tone and lack of excessive porosity. It wasn’t rag paper. It was unborn animal skin, the medium reserved for words meant to endure for eternity.

Elías drew out the document a mere few centimeters, just enough to read the heading. The calligraphy was transitional Caroline, elegant, compressed, traced with iron-gall ink that had bitten into the support, almost piercing through it.

His nearsighted eyes focused on the first words. Latin flowed into his mind, translating not as a dead tongue, but as a living admonition.

*Non Sanctus, Sed Stella.*

“Not Saint, but Star.”

Elías blinked. He reread it. The phrase was a theological aberration. A heresy penned with the clarity of dogma. In Santiago Cathedral, where everything revolved around the Apostle’s sanctity, that denial of the Saint was the most sacrilegious of acts, the very demolition of its foundations.

A vertigo unrelated to the height churned his stomach. It wasn’t a prayer. It was a confession. Or an accusation.

Below, an iron door clanged shut, jarring him back to reality. Heavy footsteps echoed in the transept. Someone was nearing the base of the scaffolding.

A sharp, fierce panic shattered the spell of his academic trance. If they found him with that in hand, if they saw he had desecrated the structure unsupervised, his career —the only thing he truly had left— would end before dusk. Yet, turning over the discovery would mean its disappearance into the Cathedral Chapter’s archives, perhaps forever, buried under layers of bureaucracy or implacable ecclesiastical censorship.

His eyes fixed on the empty hollow in the stone. Then on the cylinder clutched in his hand. “The absolute truth,” he reminded himself. His old obsession. His damnation.

With a swift motion, uncharacteristic of his usual clumsiness, Elías slid the cylinder into his tool bag. He tucked it beneath a solvent-stained rag. He adjusted his spectacles once more. His heart still raced, pumping hot blood to his temples, yet his hands reclaimed the scalpel, falling back into the task’s automation. When the site foreman peered up the ladder barely five minutes later, he found only a restorer, subdued and methodical, meticulously cleaning the robe of a stone prophet, as the rain continued to wash away the outside world’s grime.

## CHAPTER 2: The Intruder on the Scaffold

The descent from the Portico's granite chill to the sterile warmth of the restoration annex brought no solace. Rather, the abrupt shift in atmosphere struck him like an unseen blow. Rain, still clinging to his tweed jacket, began to steam off in the lab's heating system. A thick cloud of wet wool and stale dampness enveloped him, clashing harshly with the biting tang of acetone and industrial solvents that permeated the room.

The leather cylinder, pressed against his ribs beneath his clothing, felt heavier than the Cathedral's ancient stones themselves. Each step reverberated on the white linoleum, a rubbery squeal that sounded like a shriek of confession. His right leg, protesting the cramped posture on the scaffolds, carried a dull ache, a keen reminder of his own physical frailty.

Elías set his toolbag on the stainless steel table with exaggerated precision, fearing the faintest clink of scalpels would expose his transgression. He had to conceal the parchment. He needed time. Above all, he needed his hands to cease fluttering like dead leaves in a gale.

The lab door swung open before he could craft a strategy.

No quiet entrance this. The hydraulic mechanism hissed, and two figures stormed his fragile sanctuary. First, Monsignor Camiña’s immaculate cassock, black as an unplumbed chasm, devouring the harsh light of the fluorescents. Behind him, a woman who seemed to draw the air from the room.

"Doctor Varela," Camiña's voice was oil on water, smooth yet separate from the room's strained atmosphere. "I regret interrupting your... communion with the dust."

Elías whirled, stepping between the newcomers and his toolbag. He adjusted his glasses, a futile gesture to sharpen the blurred edges of his panic.

"Monsignor. I wasn't expecting visitors. The contamination protocol..."

"The protocol bends to the Church's needs, Elías." With a theatrical sweep of his hand, Camiña revealed his companion. "Allow me to introduce Doctor Sarah Al-Fayed. Dispatched directly by UNESCO."

Elías blinked, struggling to bring her into sharp relief. The woman clashed starkly with the venerable solemnity of the Cathedral. She wore cargo pants bristling with pockets and a technical anorak that spoke of mountains and deserts, not archives and libraries. Her hair, a torrent of dark curls tamed into a severe braid, revealed a chiseled face and eyes that didn't merely observe, but dissected.

"Doctor Varela," she said. Her Spanish possessed a pinpoint exactness, devoid of any regional inflection. "I've read your thesis on Visigothic paleography. Brilliant in theory. We'll see how it fares in practice."

She extended a hand. Her skin felt rough, weathered; Elías's was pale and smudged with ink. The handshake was brief, firm, more a test of tensile strength than a greeting.

"Doctor Al-Fayed is here to oversee the restoration's final phase," Camiña added, observing the interaction with the detached interest of an entomologist observing two insects in a jar. "UNESCO demands assurances. And outcomes. Time is short, Elías."

"History doesn't keep to a timetable, Monsignor," Elías retorted, shielding himself behind his customary academic arrogance to disguise the tremor in his knees.

Sarah stepped toward the workbench, disregarding their exchange. Her hiking boots made a weighty, decisive sound. Elías felt an irrational urge to intercept her, to prevent her from approaching the bag where the leather cylinder lay incandescent with secrecy.

"History perhaps not," Sarah interjected, drawing a gloved finger along the edge of a sample tray, "but funding certainly does. And the safeguarding of heritage, too."

She turned sharply toward them, her dark eyes impaling Elías. "There are rumors, Doctor. The antiquities black market is stirring. Whispers circulate of artifacts vanishing from digs before cataloging." Her gaze dropped to Elías's toolbag. "UNESCO will not countenance neglect. Or 'accidents.'"

Elías's stomach clenched, a churning knot of acid and dread. Did they know something? Was it possible the cavity in the trumeau held some kind of sensor? No, absurd. It was twelfth-century stone. But the timeliness of the warning, just as the parchment seared against his ribs, brought on a sickening lurch.

"There's no neglect here," Elías said, his voice coming out higher than he intended. He cleared his throat, trying to reclaim his customary baritone. "Only scientific rigor."

Camiña stepped into Elías's personal sphere, bringing with him the scent of costly incense and lavender soap. "We expect as much, my son. The Church places its trust in you. But trust is precarious. Should any... irregularity surface, the protection I extend to you now would dissipate, weightless as a dried wisp in the wind."

The priest smiled, but the mirth never touched his gray eyes. It was a veiled menace, swathed in velvet.

Sarah, all the while, had not taken her eyes off Elías. Her gaze settled on the paleographer's hands, resting on the table, taut. The persistent ink stain on his right middle finger seemed to deepen under her scrutiny, a brand of culpability, plain for any who knew how to seek out fault. She noted the tightness in his tendons, the sheen of sweat on his forehead despite the chill Elías carried in from the outside.

"You are very pale, Varela," Sarah observed. No trace of concern colored her voice; it was a pure, detached appraisal. "And your hands... do you have difficulties with fine motor control? That would pose an unacceptable risk to handle manuscripts."

Elías plunged his hands into his jacket pockets, brushing the stolen cylinder's leather casing. Contact with the incriminating evidence lent him an unsettling clarity, the desperate acuity of a trapped animal.

"It's the chill from the scaffolding. Poor circulation," he lied, hating the ease with which the lie formed. "And the thrill of discovery, I suppose."

The silence that followed was thick, laden with motes of suspended dust. Sarah tilted her head, the sharp tilt of a raptor that had sensed the slightest tremor in the grass.

"Discovery?" she asked quietly.

"Have you found something new in the trumeau, Elías?" Camiña's voice tightened, shedding its unctuous sheen for a fleeting second.

Elías registered his blunder. He had spoken too quickly. His mind raced, seeking an escape in the labyrinth of his technical expertise, something sufficiently dull to deter further inquiry, yet plausible enough to account for his demeanor.

"Salt efflorescence," he blurted. He snatched a clean scalpel from the table and twirled it between his fingers, seeking a visual anchor. "An uncommon crystallization of nitrates at the column's base. This could signal undetected water ingress from the foundations. If the stone is structurally imperiled..."

Sarah frowned, absorbing the intelligence. "If there are structural leaks, we'd have to seal off the entire Portico. Did you take samples?"

"Of course." Elías waved a hand vaguely toward a stack of empty Petri dishes at the far end of the lab, well away from his bag. "They're... processing. They require drying time."

Sarah held his gaze. She didn't believe him. Or not entirely, at any rate. A disconnect existed between Elías's physical agitation, his shallow breathing, and the mundane talk of mineral salts. She took a step toward him, breaching his personal space. Elías could scent the leather of her jacket and a faint trace of bitter coffee.

"I want to see those samples the moment they are ready," she ordered. Her tone left no doubt this was no request. "And I want to inspect the trumeau myself. First thing tomorrow."

"Access is restricted..." Elías began.

"I hold Tier-one clearance, Doctor. I can enter the royal crypt itself if I deem it necessary." Sarah turned to Camiña. "Monsignor, I require updated schematics of prior interventions. If structural damage exists, priorities shift. Aesthetics become secondary."

Camiña nodded, though his jaw was rigid. He disliked yielding control of the narrative. "Of course, Doctor Al-Fayed. My office is at your disposal. Elías..." The priest pinned the paleographer with his gaze again. "Ensure those 'salts' are the sole surprise. We wish no unnecessary alarm for the Chapter."

"I'm just doing my job," Elías murmured, the lie leaving a coppery taste in his mouth.

Camiña gestured toward the door, motioning for Sarah to depart. She paused at the threshold, turning one last time. Her gaze raked Elías from head to toe: the damp jacket, the defensive stance, the hand instinctively guarding the side where he concealed the cylinder.

"Doctor Varela," she said. Her voice had dropped, becoming almost conspiratorial, but her eyes stayed frigid. "Mind what you handle. Sometimes, history bites back."

The door sealed behind them with a pneumatic sigh, leaving Elías alone with the drone of the fluorescents and the reverberation of his own heart thudding against his ribs. He withdrew his hand from his pocket, shaking, and felt the cylinder's leather through the cloth. Safe, for now. But the woman's gaze, that shrewd, assessing darkness, etched itself into his memory. She knew he lied. She merely had to uncover why.

Elías slumped onto the lab stool, expelling the air he'd held in his lungs until they ached. The game had changed. He was no longer the academic in pursuit of truth; he had transformed into solitary quarry in an exposed wilderness, and the hunters had just made their presence known.

## Chapter 3: The Blood Canticle

The journey from the laboratory to the Chapter Library was a streaked blur of wet cobblestones and slanting rain lashing his face. Elías Varela limped, his right leg protesting with each impact against the drenched granite, a stinging reminder of his own fragility. Under his tweed jacket, the leather cylinder holding the stolen parchment pressed against his ribs, hard and accusing, like a second calcified heart.

Crossing the library's threshold, the shift in atmosphere felt physical, like passing through a veil of icy water into a crypt. The dense, acrid-sweet scent of old leather, oxidized wax, and centuries of dust filled his lungs, displacing the clean aroma of the storm.

Inspector Valdés waited for him in the center of the reading room, a figure silhouetted against the mahogany shelves like a monolith of judgment. He was not alone.

“Don’t come any closer, Varela,” the officer warned. His voice lacked its usual warmth; it was flat, professional, perilous.

Elías halted, compulsively wiping raindrops from his spectacles with his shirt-tail, a nervous tic he couldn’t master. When he finally settled the lenses on the bridge of his nose, the world regained its clarity, and the horror sharpened into focus.

Don Manuel, the head archivist, lay sprawled on the central oak table. Or what remained of him.

This was no chaotic death. No frenzy had occurred. The old man’s body had been arranged with an obscene geometric precision. His left arm stretched toward the room’s magnetic north, palm open and impaled to the wood with a bronze stiletto. His right leg, bent at an unnatural angle suggesting torn ligaments, pointed east. His head, twisted backward in an impossible contortion, stared at the vaulted ceiling with glassy eyes that no longer registered the leaks.

Elías felt bile surge in his throat, acidic and hot. Yet his mind, trained to find patterns in the chaos of ancient script, could not help but catalog what he saw. This wasn't murder; it was an installation.

“Cantiga 103,” he whispered, his voice a mere wisp of air.

Valdés snapped his head around.

“What did you say?”

Elías pointed with a trembling finger, careful not to approach the yellow tape that cordoned off the perimeter.

“The pose. It’s… it’s medieval iconography. The monk who listened to the devil and was warped by his vanity. He’s mimicking a thirteenth-century miniature.”

The inspector stepped closer, invading Elías’s personal space. He smelled of stale tobacco and machine-brewed coffee.

“You were with him yesterday,” Valdés said, not as a question, but as an accusation. “You argued about access to the restricted section.”

“We argued about bureaucracy, Inspector. We always argued. It was our… dynamic.” Elías tried to swallow, but his mouth was a desert of ash. “I didn’t do this to him.”

“Someone came in here looking for something very specific, Professor.” Valdés gestured around.

For the first time, Elías tore his gaze from the corpse and observed his surroundings. The library had been ransacked. The volumes weren't simply scattered; they had been disemboweled. Gutted codices lay across the floor like dead birds, their bindings torn away, vellum pages ripped apart in search of false compartments or concealed messages.

The destruction was systematic.

“Nothing of monetary value was taken,” Valdés went on, watching Elías’s every subtle gesture. “The incunabula are there. The silver, too. Whoever did this was looking for paper. Information.”

The cylinder beneath Elías’s jacket seemed to double its weight. The leather felt scorching against his skin. *They were looking for what I have.*

“Look at the blood, Varela,” the inspector commanded, pointing to the stone floor.

Elías forced his gaze downward. Don Manuel’s blood hadn't pooled in a shapeless puddle. It had threaded along the seams of the granite slabs, guided by channels someone had previously carved into the stone, invisible until the lifeblood filled them.

They formed curved lines, intersecting arcs. These were no random stains.

“It’s a star map,” Elías murmured, understanding slamming into him with the force of a sledgehammer. “The blood traces the constellation Eridanus. The River.”

“Does that mean anything to you?” Valdés took another step, pinning Elías against a shelf of canon law books.

“It means the killer believes the path to heaven is paved with blood,” Elías replied, unconsciously citing an apocryphal text while his mind spun furiously.

The body’s arrangement, the constellation drawn on the floor, the methodical destruction of the archives… Everything pointed to one truth: whoever had killed Don Manuel knew the parchment existed, but not where it lay. The archivist had died protecting the secret, or perhaps tortured to reveal it. And now, that secret was pressed against Elías’s side, separated from the inspector’s view by barely two layers of thin cloth.

A chilling certainty settled in Elías’s chest. Panic ebbed away, leaving behind a cold, almost analytical terror. He was no longer just an academic who had stolen a document to salvage his career; he was the bearer of a death warrant.

“Varela?” Valdés’s voice was a whip-crack. “I asked you a question. Did the archivist know anything that might cost him his life?”

Elías met the inspector’s eyes through his smudged lenses. He saw suspicion in the policeman’s gaze, the intuition of a hunter who senses their prey conceals a wound. If he spoke, if he surrendered the parchment now, he would be safe from the law, but the discovery would be lost in police bureaucracy, or worse, fall into the hands of those who had perpetrated *this*.

“Don Manuel knew many things, Inspector,” Elías lied, with a voice that surprised him with its firmness. “But he was a man of faith. His secrets were sacred trusts, not criminal.”

Valdés held his gaze for an eternal moment, assessing the stooped man’s truthfulness. Finally, he sighed in frustration and stepped back.

“Don’t leave the city, Varela. And if you recall any more ‘academic details,’ I want to be the first to know.”

“Of course.”

Elías turned to leave, his limp more pronounced now that adrenaline began to mix with exhaustion. He walked among the mangled books, feeling as though he trod on corpses.

Stepping out again into Santiago’s leaden, rainy afternoon, the downpour failed to wash away the feeling of defilement. The grey sky, heavy as a tombstone, pressed down on the city, and the first shadows of nightfall began to stretch their claws over the Plaza de las Platerías. Elías clutched the parchment to his side, protecting it, and plunged into the stone maze, knowing he no longer walked alone. History had ceased to be something to be read, transforming into something that bled.

## Chapter 4: Sombras en el Claustro

CHAPTER 4: Shadows in the Cloister

The journey from Plaza de las Platerías to Rúa do Vilar felt like a descent into an underwater world. The deluge gave no quarter; it turned Santiago's cobblestones into a slick, black mirror where streetlamps dissolved into blotches of oily light. Elías Varela pressed himself against the arcades, shoulders hunched, the leather cylinder held tight against his ribs beneath his soaked tweed jacket. Cold water seeped down his collar, but the glacial dread clutching at his stomach had nothing to do with the weather.

Every shadow cast by the granite columns seemed a menace. The sound of his own steps, echoing on the wet flagstones, mingled with the incessant drumming of rain against the gutters, creating a cacophony that kept him from telling if anyone followed. He dared not look back. The Archivist's image, that grotesque imitation of star-blood, remained seared into his memory with the fidelity of an etching.

He reached his building entrance, a narrow door of noble wood, riddled by centuries of Galician damp. His numb, trembling fingers fumbled at the lock three times before the key finally turned. He plunged inside, closing the heavy portal with his back, breathing in the stale air of the vestibule. It smelled of stone dust and old wax. Silence. Only the wild pulse thrumming in his temples broke the building's stillness.

He ascended the three flights of stairs two steps at a time, ignoring the burn in his lungs. His apartment on the top floor was his sanctuary, his private *scriptorium*, the sole place where the chaos of the outer world yielded to the taxonomic order of his books.

When he opened the door, the illusion of safety shattered.

He didn't need to switch on the light to know his sanctuary had been defiled. The hallway's darkness wasn't absolute; the street's orange glow filtered through the windows, revealing an altered landscape. The floor, normally clear, presented an uneven, mounded texture. Elías took a hesitant step and something crunched beneath his sole. He knelt to feel it. Paper. Torn pages.

A muffled groan escaped his throat. He groped his way toward the study. He flipped the switch, but the bulb stayed dark. He pulled the headlamp from his pocket, the same one he'd used in the Cathedral, and its white beam cleaved the darkness.

The devastation was complete. His bookshelves, sorted by century and origin, had been emptied. Volumes lay disemboweled across the Persian rug, their spines broken and bindings ripped. This was no common theft; thieves sought money, jewels, technology. This was a surgical hunt, executed with systematic savagery. They sought information. They sought the parchment he felt burning against his side.

Elías stumbled back, dizzy from the sight of his academic life dismembered. His foot struck a pile of facsimile incunabula. The sound was dry, yet in the apartment's silence, it rang out like a gunshot.

"The classification was incorrect," a voice spoke.

It came not from the door, nor the hallway. It came from the room's darkest corner, beside the window overlooking the inner courtyard.

Elías directed the light beam there. The figure coalesced from the shadows, as if an extension of them. It was immense. A giant dressed in dark technical attire, whose shaved head gleamed pale in the LED light. Most terrifying wasn't his size, but his stillness. He wasn't breathing heavily from the exertion of the destruction. He stood there, rooted with the solidity of a menhir, arms relaxed at his sides.

His face lacked eyebrows, which lent his blue gaze an inhuman, reptilian intensity.

"Wh-where is it?" Elías stammered. The question felt absurd, but panic had hijacked his logic.

"Heresy hides in paper," the intruder replied. His voice was a low, monotonous thrum, devoid of any emotional inflection. "But flesh is easier to read."

The giant advanced. He didn't run. No battle cries issued forth. He simply closed the distance with two fluid, silent strides, incongruous for a man of his bulk.

The instinct for survival, that reptilian brain Elías believed atrophied by years of reading, took over. The paleographer hurled the flashlight directly at his assailant's face and dove left, seeking sanctuary behind the solid oak desk.

The man didn't even blink, swatting the flashlight aside with a casual hand. Elías heard the plastic crack against the opposite wall. The room plunged into gloom, illuminated only by the urban glow filtering through the window.

Elías scrambled frantically behind the desk. He remembered the letter opener, a replica of a Toledo dagger, kept in the central drawer. He tugged at the knob. Locked. Curse his habit of locking things.

A hand the size of a digging shovel gripped the desk's edge. With a single hip thrust, the intruder overturned the hundred-kilo piece of furniture as if it were papier-mâché. Elías tumbled across the floor, missing being crushed by inches as the wood splintered and drawers burst open, scattering fountain pens and cataloguing cards.

He lay supine, exposed. The giant's silhouette loomed over him, blotting out the window.

"Hand it over," the man stated. It was not a request; it was a verdict. "And the purification will be swift."

Elías clawed backward on his elbows, his heels slipping on the loose pages of his beloved books. His right hand, reaching for support, closed around something cold and metallic that had fallen from his toolkit during the fall: the scalpel.

The killer bent to grab him by the collar. There was no haste in his movements, only terrifying efficiency. He knew his prey had no escape.

But Elías knew the topography of his own chaos. He knew that just behind the giant, the wooden floor contained a rotten board he'd avoided stepping on for months. And he knew the stack of Espasa-Calpe encyclopedias swaying to the intruder's right was structurally unsound.

Elías didn't attack the man. He attacked the environment.

With a cry that was more the squeal of a cornered rodent, he kicked the base of the metal shelving unit supporting the encyclopedias. The furniture, already precarious after the ransacking, gave way.

Tons of glossy paper and hardcovers cascaded upon the giant. It wasn't enough to stop him, but it broke his perfect balance. The man took an instinctive step back, and his heavy boot landed precisely where Elías had hoped: on the rotten plank.

The wood groaned with a wet snap and yielded beneath the hundred and ten kilograms of muscle. The intruder's leg sank to the knee into the old floor's framework, trapped between beams and splinters.

For the first time, the expressionless face showed a flicker of surprise.

Elías didn't wait. He scrambled up, slipping, and bolted for the hallway. But the giant was quick. Even trapped, his arm shot out like a whip. Steely fingers clamped around Elías's ankle.

The paleographer fell flat, air punched from his lungs as he hit the floor. He felt himself being dragged back, toward the darkness. The giant's nails dug into his flesh through his corduroy trousers.

Elías twisted around, consumed by absolute terror. He clutched the scalpel in his right hand. He didn't think of anatomy, or vital points. He simply flailed his arm with the desperation of a drowning man.

The surgical blade, honed for cutting ancient parchment, found the giant's wrist. There was resistance, then a clean cut.

The grip instantly slackened. Warm blood spattered Elías's face, blinding him for a moment.

The giant didn't cry out. He only emitted a sharp hiss, retracting his hand to inspect the damage with an almost clinical curiosity.

That second of analysis was all Elías needed. He lurched to his feet, unsteady, and sprinted. Not toward the main door – he knew with the bolt thrown, it would take too long to open – but toward the kitchen.

He dashed through the darkened hallway, guided by muscle memory, dodging the heaps of books littering the floor. He heard the creaking wood behind him. The giant had freed himself. Heavy footsteps, now quickening, thudded on the floor, vibrating the walls.

He burst into the kitchen and slammed the door shut, barricading it with a chair wedged beneath the knob, a ludicrous defense against such force. He flung himself at the small window that faced the lightwell. It was a disused service exit, leading to an old, rusted iron fire escape shared with the adjacent building.

Elías wrestled with the latch, seized by disuse. Behind him, the kitchen door shuddered from a brutal impact. The wood splintered around the hinges.

"Open, damn you!" he sobbed.

A second blow. The chair flew through the air, shattered.

The latch gave way, tearing away paint and a strip of his skin. Elías shoved open the window panes, and rain and wind rushed in, lashing his face. He clambered onto the sill just as the giant's bloodied hand punched through the shattered door panel, reaching for the inside knob.

Elías leaped.

He landed poorly on the metal grating platform, slick with moss and water. His left knee struck the iron with a sickening crack, and pain shot up his leg like white lightning to his hip. He bit his tongue to keep from screaming, tasting the coppery tang of blood in his mouth.

He forced himself to his feet. He couldn't stay there. He looked up. In the illuminated frame of his kitchen window, the Pilgrim's massive silhouette filled the aperture. The killer watched him, motionless in the rain that now soaked him too, blood from his wrist dripping black into the darkness.

He didn't attempt to follow him on the flimsy structure. He knew it wouldn't bear his weight. He simply observed, committing the direction of escape to memory.

Elías descended the emergency stairs, limping, dragging his left leg which now throbbed with a dull fire. He reached the back alley, a maze of dumpsters and deep puddles.

He kept running, though his lungs burned and his glasses, askew and smudged, barely let him see. He melted into the Santiago night, a fugitive in his own city, knowing with absolute certainty that the security of his old life had perished in that apartment, shattered alongside his books.

## Chapter 5: Alianza Forzada

CHAPTER 5 - Forced Alliance

The city of Santiago wasn't merely damp; it was drowning. The cobbles of Rúa do Vilar, burnished by centuries of soles and penance, had turned into obsidian mirrors, warping the lamplight's glow. Elías Varela hugged the granite walls, seeking to meld with the slick stone. Each stride struck a bargain with gravity and agony. His right leg, mangled from the scramble through the service shaft, sent no sharp jabs, but a leaden drag, as if his ligaments had turned to sodden esparto cords, fraying at the breaking point.

He did not run. Running drew eyes, and in that drenched predawn gloom, to be seen meant to be snared. He pressed the leather cylinder against his ribs, tucked under a tweed jacket that weighed three kilos more than usual, bloated with absorbed water. The chill wasn't a degree on a thermometer; it was a physical presence, gnawing at his neck, striving to seep into his bloodstream.

The Hostal, where Sarah lodged, loomed like a bastion of gloom and sickly yellow light. Elías avoided the main entrance. He knew, from past conferences where budgets had afforded him luxuries now distant, that the laundry service door often stood ajar for the early morning shifts. A gust of industrial detergent and hot steam struck his face as he slipped inside, a stark rupture from the metallic tang of the storm.

He climbed the service stairs. One, two, three floors. His breath rasped like a ruptured bellows in the stairwell. He paused before door 314. His hand, smudged with ink and mud, shook as it neared the wood. There was no retreating. Beyond lay the only soul capable of deciphering the language of the dead, or the woman who would deliver him to the living, to be locked away.

He knocked. Three sharp raps.

The corridor's hush stretched thin, heavy and condemning.

He struck again, his knuckles bleached white from the strain.

“Who?” The voice on the other side sounded sharp, devoid of any sleepy haze. Sarah Al-Fayed wasn't asleep; she was waiting.

“It's me. Elías.” His own voice sounded alien, raspy, as if it belonged to a stranger.

The deadbolt clicked, yet the security chain held the door to just a sliver. A dark, almond-shaped eye, severe and probing, surveyed him from the gloom.

“You have ten seconds before I scream loud enough to rouse the kings in the Cathedral,” she whispered. There was no fear in her tone, only a measured menace.

“I didn't do it, Sarah.” Elías braced himself against the doorframe, his legs faltering. Water streamed from his hair, pooling dark on the carpet. “He was there. The Pilgrim.”

“The police say you fled. That the apartment resembles a butchery.”

“Because he came to finish the job.” Elías raised the leather cylinder. The hallway light coaxed a dull gleam from the case's worn surface. “I have why the archivist died.”

Sarah's gaze dropped to the object. A pause stretched, a fleeting calculation where academic curiosity waged a silent war against the urge for self-preservation. The chain unlatched.

“Enter. And touch nothing.”

The room was swathed in dimness, save for a cone of golden light cast by an Art Deco desk lamp onto a table piled with papers. Elías hobbled in, leaving a damp trail that marred the space's pristine order. Sarah closed the door and turned the key twice. She wore a grey cotton t-shirt and sweatpants, but her feet were shod in military boots, as though poised for an instant departure. Half-concealed against her thigh, she gripped a heavy bronze letter opener.

“If this is one of your wild theories to salvage your reputation, I'll call the station myself,” she said, holding her distance. Her stance was coiled, ready for rupture.

Elías slumped into the nearest chair, ignoring the warning to touch nothing. His lungs burned. He set the cylinder on the table, under the circle of light. His fingers, numb from the cold, fumbled with the clasp.

“It's not a theory. It's a map.”

Sarah stepped closer. The letter opener dipped a fraction, yet she did not release it. She watched Elías draw forth the parchment. The scent of cured leather, of stagnated time and oak galls, filled the room, elbowing aside the hotel's sterile fragrance.

Elías unrolled the document with the veneration one shows a sacred explosive. He used two paperweights from the side table to hold it open.

There, beneath the electric glow, the ink pulsed with life. It wasn't classical Latin. The script was dense, compressed, a Visigothic minuscule that resembled barbed wire etched on skin. But it wasn't just words. The text coiled, forming spirals that mimicked celestial orbits.

Sarah released the letter opener. The metal struck the carpet with a muted thud, yet she remained oblivious. She leaned over the table, her dark eyes devouring the markings.

“This can't be...” she breathed, her voice shedding its imperative edge to become raspy, reverent. “The texture of the support... it's uterine vellum. Twelfth century, perhaps late eleventh.”

“Read the heading,” Elías pressed, polishing his glasses with a dry edge of his shirt, a nervous tic that not even panic could quell.

She narrowed her eyes, following Elías's ink-stained finger.

“*Iter Stellarum Nigrarum*... The Path of the Black Stars.” She jolted upright, as if the parchment had scorched her. “The legend of the Priscillianists.”

“The Heresy,” Elías corrected. “They believe the tomb in the Cathedral is a fabrication. That the true body, that of the Master, rests beneath a distinct stellar alignment.”

Sarah circled the table. No longer did she regard Elías as a suspect, but as a trove of information. The adrenaline of fear had transmuted into the exhilaration of discovery.

“When I presented my doctoral thesis on the hidden symbolism in the Portico de la Gloria,” Sarah spoke, more to herself than to him, “the committee laughed. They claimed my interpretation of the archivolts as an inverse astronomical map was 'unsubstantiated fantasy.' They called me a novelist.”

She looked at Elías, and for the first time, he glimpsed a rift in her cynical facade. There was hunger in that gaze. A hunger for vindication.

“They denied me the professorship for this, Elías. For insisting a 'Codex of Night' existed.”

“Well, here you have it,” Elías gestured to the parchment. “Proof you were right. And why someone slit my mentor's throat and then came for me with a suppressor.”

Sarah leaned over the document again. Her fingers traced the air above the central drawing, never quite making contact.

“Look at this.” She pointed to a cluster of dots in the bottom left corner. “They aren't cities. They're constellations. But the projection is off.”

“It's not off,” Elías said, briefly reclaiming the paleographer's authority. “It's dated. If you adjust for the precession of the equinoxes...”

“...you're cast back not to the twelfth century, but to the fourth,” she finished, completing his sentence with a swiftness that stole Elías's breath. Their minds clicked with the precision of forgotten clockwork. “The era of Priscillian.”

Sarah snatched a hotel notepad and a pen. She began to scrawl frantically, translating marginal glosses, converting archaic terms into coordinates.

“*Sub umbra Scorpii*... Under the Scorpion's shadow,” she murmured. “Elías, this doesn't point to the Cathedral. It points to Pico Sacro.”

The name dropped between them like a stone in a deep well. Pico Sacro. The mythical mountain, queen of the Galician peaks, rife with caves and dragon lore.

“That's where the disciples first carried the body,” Elías whispered. “Before the official Church 'discovered' it in the field of stars.”

“If this is real...” Sarah looked up, and the gleam in her eyes was unnerving, “...it rewrites the history of Western Christianity. The Apostle's tomb would be a deliberate fraud.”

A sharp knock on the room door chilled the air.

It wasn't a room service summons. It was a hammer blow of authority. Hard knuckles against rich wood.

“Police! Open the door!”

Elías felt his stomach knot into a hard ball. He looked towards the window. Rain hammered the glass as though yearning to break in and rescue them.

“They know I'm here,” he whispered.

Sarah glanced at the door, then at Elías, and finally at the parchment. In that three-sided choice, Elías saw her entire career flash by: the years of study, her colleagues' scorn, the solitude of holding a truth no one would hear. If she opened the door, Elías would fall, and the parchment would vanish into some Vatican evidence vault, lost for good. If she didn't open...

Sarah coiled the parchment in a fluid motion and tossed it to Elías.

“To the bathroom. The window leads to the fire escape,” she commanded. Her voice had regained its military crispness. “You have three seconds.”

“And you?” he asked, snatching the cylinder.

“I'm coming with you.” Sarah was already shrugging into a leather jacket over her pajamas, stuffing her wallet and phone into its pockets with brutal efficiency. “If they find this without me, they'll seize the credit. If they find you, the truth will be lost.”

“Open up or we're coming in!” roared the voice from the corridor.

“Coming! I'm getting dressed!” Sarah yelled, her voice feigning sleepiness and indignation, as she shoved Elías towards the bathroom.

She twisted the shower faucet to full blast, drowning out the window's groan as it opened. Icy, damp air burst into the bathroom, carrying the scent of ozone and peril.

“This is insane,” Elías said, one foot already on the slick sill. Below, the alley yawned like a dark maw.

“It's history, Elías,” she replied, killing the bathroom light and clambering out after him. “And history is written by those who survive. Move.”

They spilled out into the night, abandoning safety, the law, and academic life. They descended into the shadows where truth lay in wait, sharp-edged and ravenous.

## Chapter 6: La Fuga de Compostela

CAPÍTULO: 6 - The Santiago Escape

The dawn over Santiago brought no light, but a watery gloom that blurred the edges of reality. The sky had collapsed onto the cobblestones, turning the street into a torrent of slate and filthy foam. This was no mere rainfall; it was a sheet of liquid steel lashing down, ricocheting off the granite buildings with the clamor of a thousand war drums.

Elías Varela limped towards the underground car park beneath Plaza de Galicia, each stride an agonizing negotiation with his own anatomy. His injured leg felt less like a part of him and more like a strange, burning thing, as if a rod of ground glass had been thrust between his tendons. There was no rhythmic throb, only an electric stiffness that threatened to buckle him if he put too much weight on his right side.

"Move, Elías!" Sarah Al-Fayed's voice cut through the water's roar. She was already ten feet ahead, her silhouette etched against the perpetual grey, her soaked black braid whipping her back like a lash.

Elías pressed the leather cylinder against his ribs, shielding it beneath his drenched tweed jacket. The scent of wet wool and ozone clogged his nostrils. They reached Sarah's rental car, a compact utility vehicle, anonymity-grey, parked in the gloom of the lower level.

She unlatched the boot with a fluid movement, tossing her backpack and gear inside.

"Get in. Now."

The car's cabin took them in like a decompression chamber. The storm's clamor changed at once, shifting from an open roar to a muffled, constant drumming on the metal roof. Elías dropped into the passenger seat, exhaling a white mist that instantly clouded his glasses. He took them off, rubbing the lenses with his damp tie, a futile gesture. His hands shook, not from cold, but from the adrenaline surge flooding his bloodstream, leaving a metallic tang on his tongue.

The engine purred to life. Sarah wasted no time adjusting mirrors or seats; her hands clasped the steering wheel with a technician's grip, knuckles stark white against her olive skin.

"Do you have the map?" she asked, slamming the car into first gear.

"Here." Elías patted the cylinder. "But we need to get out of the city before trying to read anything. The damp... the parchment wouldn't hold up."

The car climbed the spiral ramp. Elías felt centrifugal force tugging his stomach earthward. As they surfaced, reality slapped them with a burst of strobing lights.

Fifty yards away, blocking the main exit to Alameda, two National Police cruisers formed a barrier of steel and blue light. Their rotating flashes mirrored in the puddles, painting a dizzying kaleidoscope across the stone facades. An officer in a brilliant yellow slicker gestured forcefully for a delivery truck to stop.

"Damn it," Sarah whispered. The word sounded oddly clinical, stripped of panic.

Elías felt his throat constrict, a pneumatic pressure that kept him from swallowing.

"They're looking for us," he said, the obvious truth hanging in the air like smoke. "Valdés hasn't wasted a moment. They've sealed off the perimeter."

"They can't have closed every exit. Santiago's a maze." Sarah braked sharply before entering the officers' direct line of sight. She threw the car into reverse without looking, guiding it only by the side mirrors with pinpoint accuracy. The car shot backward into the shadow of the side alley.

"The historical district is a death trap, Sarah. They've got cameras in restricted access areas and patrols on the main avenues. If we try the motorway, they'll snag us at the toll booth."

Sarah wrenched the wheel, the tires squealing briefly on the wet pavement. The car spun 180 degrees, facing away from the police barricade.

"Then give me an out, Professor. You know this city stone by stone. Get us out of here without hitting those checkpoints."

Elías closed his eyes for a moment. His mind, typically an orderly archive of dates and Latin, was compelled to visualize the urban layout. Not the tourist map, but the medieval substratum, the ancient veins coursing beneath the city's modern skin. They needed an unseen path, routes forgotten by the logic of contemporary traffic.

"North," Elías said, opening his eyes. His voice emerged firmer, anchored in knowledge. "Avoid Rúa do Hórreo. You have to go down through Sar."

"Through Sar? That's away from the sea."

"Trust me. The checkpoints will be on the main arteries leading to the coast and the plateau. Nobody watches the secondary roads climbing the mountain at this hour."

Sarah floored it. The car shot off, devouring the asphalt. Elías clung to the door's overhead handle as she took a tight turn at a speed that defied the wet ground's friction. She drove with calculated aggression, exploiting every gap in the morning traffic, anticipating the lights. This wasn't the driving of an academic; it was that of someone who had learned to flee in hostile territory.

They sped past the Colegiata, a dark mass under the downpour.

"Right here," Elías directed, pointing to a narrow lane flanked by moss-covered masonry walls. "It's the old tanners' path. It's tight, but we'll come out onto the Santa Marta road without hitting the main streets."

Sarah didn't hesitate. The car plunged into the alley. The side mirrors skimmed inches from the rough stone. Elías held his breath, instinctively hunching his shoulders, as if making himself smaller could shrink the car's width.

Without warning, a siren wailed in the distance, a mechanical lament drawing closer.

"Have they seen us?" Sarah asked, her eyes riveted to the strip of asphalt visible between the frantic wipers.

"I don't know. Keep going. At the top of the rise, turn left onto the Pedroso road. It's a dead end for most, leading only to the antennae and the forest park. There won't be a checkpoint there."

The car bounced over a speed bump, sending a jolt of white-hot pain through Elías's leg that made him clench his teeth until his gums ached. The leather cylinder rolled onto his lap. He snatched it before it could drop to the floor. That tube held the reason for their flight and, quite possibly, for their ruin.

They cleared the urban maze. Tall apartment blocks and office buildings yielded to detached houses and, then, to dense stands of eucalyptus and oak. The road narrowed and began to climb in winding turns.

Behind them, down in the valley, the flashing blue police lights flickered like furious fireflies, centered on the city's heart, far from their location.

Elías let out a breath. The air inside the car was thick with heater warmth and static tension. He glanced through the rear window. Santiago dissolved behind the curtain of rain, an island of grey stone swallowed by the mist.

"We're clear," he murmured, though the certainty brought him no peace, only a different unease. Freedom meant they were now alone, without civilization's shield, exposed in the open country.

Sarah slowed to a more human pace, though her hands didn't ease their grip on the wheel.

"Good. Phase one complete," she said, her tone regaining its armored pragmatism. "Now we're in no man's land. Where are we truly headed, Elías? Because climbing the mountain only buys us time, it doesn't give us direction."

Elías ran a hand over the cylinder's worn leather. The answer wasn't in his head; it was rolled up inside that tube.

"Find somewhere to pull over. A discreet lay-by. We need light and quiet." He looked at his hands, still stained with ink and hotel grime. "What's in here... it changes the geography. We're not going where the road maps point."

The rain continued to hammer the roof, but now it sounded different. No longer the city's chaos, it was the steady, ancient rhythm of Galician nature, heedless of their small human urgencies. Elías gazed at the forest closing in on both sides of the road, dark branches intertwining like the fingers of a giant skeleton. They had crossed the threshold. They were no longer investigators; they were fugitives on a pilgrimage into the dark.

## CHAPTER 7: The Bridge of Heretics

The descent from Mount Pedroso brought its own silence, its solemn weight. Sarah's SUV engine purred, a restrained beast devouring the sharp bends while Santiago shrank behind them, lost in a dread of sirens and checkpoints. Twenty minutes on the back roads, bordered by eucalyptus trees that still wept the morning's rain onto the asphalt, were enough for the landscape to utterly shift.

The mist thinned as their altitude dropped, revealing the Tambre River valley. No patrols here, only the indifferent stillness of rural Galicia.

Sarah pulled the vehicle into the shade of an ancient oak, some two hundred meters from the hamlet of Ponte Maceira. The windshield wipers ceased, leaving a final streak of dampness across the glass.

"It's too quiet," she murmured, scanning the perimeter. Her dark eyes, trained to spot peril in conflict zones, found nothing but stone and water.

Elías Varela adjusted his spectacles, which slipped down the bridge of his perspiring nose. His right leg, bruised in the hotel skirmish, throbbed with a dull cadence, detached from his racing heart.

"Tranquility cloaks history, Sarah," he replied, pushing the door open. Damp, chill air struck his face. "This place has watched Roman legions march and dying pilgrims pass. It knows how to keep secrets."

They walked toward the ancient monument. The great medieval bridge soared above the Tambre River, a stone edifice defying the ages with its pointed arches and cobbled roadway. The river, fierce and swollen by recent storms, crashed against the triangular cutwaters, structures fashioned centuries prior to cleave the current like granite blades.

Elías drew out the leather cylinder, guarding it to his chest. He extracted the parchment a mere few centimeters, just enough to verify the marginal gloss he'd committed to memory.

"*Sub arco quarto, ubi aqua obscura fluit*," he recited, his voice a bare whisper contending with the river's roar. "'Beneath the fourth arch, where dark water flows.'"

Sarah eyed the current. The water was a murky, agitated brown, laden with silt and broken branches.

"The fourth arch, counting from where, Elías?"

"From the Chapel of San Blas. The sacred side," he said, gesturing to the small hermitage to their left. "Yet the parchment is precise. It doesn't state 'on the bridge,' but rather reads 'sub pontem.' Beneath."

The historian moved to the bank. The ground proved slick, a treacherous blend of mud and wet grass.

"The river's high. If anything's down there, it's submerged."

"Then we'll have to seek it by touch."

Elías took a step onto the embankment before Sarah could stop him. His boot slid in the mire, and a jolt of pain shot through his injured thigh, forcing him to drop onto his good knee.

"Damn it!" he hissed through clenched teeth, slamming his fist onto the ground. The chagrin of his body failing him proved worse than the ache itself.

Sarah gripped his arm with a firm, nearly painful hold.

"You're not fit for this, Varela. Your leg's a dead weight now. Tell me what to search for, and I'll go down."

Elías gently but resolutely broke free. The ink stain on his middle finger seemed to pulse.

"You wouldn't know what to seek. It isn't an object, Sarah. It's an incision. The chisel's pressure, the carving's angle... A stonemason leaves his signature, but a heretic leaves a confession. I need my hands."

Without awaiting a reply, he slid down the embankment until the water licked at his boots. The cold was immediate, a biting chill that pierced leather and wool, chilling him to the bone. The Tambre wasn't merely cold; its water held the temperature of an open grave in winter.

Sarah let out a huff, resigned to the academic's stubbornness, and descended after him, bracing herself on a protruding rock to serve as an anchor if the current chose to sweep him away.

Elías forged ahead toward the fourth arch. The water rose to his knees, heavy and strong, tugging at his corduroy trousers as if unseen hands sought to drag him under. Every step was a parley with the riverbed, replete with tumbled stones and treacherous silt.

Beneath the stone vault, daylight faded. The water's roar magnified, rebounding off the granite ashlar, forging a deafening echo chamber. The scent was sharp: stale damp, decaying algae, and the mineral tang of wet rock.

"Elías!" Sarah shouted from the bank, her voice warped by the arch's acoustics. "Hurry, the level's rising!"

The paleographer disregarded the warning. He was in his element – not the water, but the past. He clicked on his headlamp, its beam cleaving the gloom, disclosing the arch's voussoirs cloaked in black, slimy moss.

"*Ubi aqua obscura fluit*," he repeated, like an incantation.

He groped at the pillar's base. His fingers, numb from the glacial chill, scraped the rough surface. He sought an anomaly. A straight line in a world of eroded forms.

The water now reached his thighs, soaking the bandage on his wound, which stung with the icy touch. His teeth chattered, but his thoughts honed in on his fingertips.

There.

Some ten centimeters below the current waterline, the stone shifted. It wasn't natural erosion. It was deliberate.

Elías gulped stale air and plunged his head and torso into the black water. The thermal shock was savage; his lungs seized, denying him oxygen for a moment of sheer terror. He opened his eyes beneath the murky surface. The headlamp's beam barely pierced the coffee-colored liquid, illuminating suspended particles that danced like dust in a gale.

He pressed his face close to the stone, scrubbing away the silt with frantic motions.

The mark appeared. It wasn't a simple stonemason's mark, those geometric signs for piecework payment. This ran deeper, more intricate.

He surfaced, coughing, gasping for air, hair plastered to his skull and spectacles dangling from one ear.

"I have it!" he cried out, his voice fractured by the cold.

Sarah waded into the water to her waist to help him out. Elías gained weight with his drenched clothing, a dead burden of saturated wool and tweed. Between them, battling the mud and gravity, they managed to clamber back onto the grassy embankment.

They collapsed onto the wet grass, breathing in ragged gasps. Elías shivered uncontrollably, his lips blue.

"Tell me it was worth the hypothermia," Sarah demanded, wringing water from her braid.

Elías chafed his arms, attempting to generate a useless friction. His gray eyes, however, glowed with a fever not born of illness.

"It wasn't a cross. Nor a shell." He paused, mastering the chatter of his teeth. "It was a pentagram. A five-pointed star."

Sarah's brow furrowed.

"A pentagram? That's pagan symbolism, or satanic in later contexts. It doesn't belong on a Christian bridge."

"Exactly." Elías pushed himself upright, heedless of the water streaming from his clothes. "But it wasn't upright. It was inverted. And one of the points... the lower point, was extended, fashioned into an arrow."

He pulled a waterlogged notebook from his inner pocket, useless now, and opted to draw in the mud with a stick. He sketched the inverted star.

"The Star of Compostela guides eastward, toward the light, toward Rome and Jerusalem. It is the path of life. But this... this denies heaven."

Sarah regarded the drawing in the mud.

"Where did the arrow on the stone point?"

Elías gazed at the bridge, orienting himself by mentally tracking the sun's position, obscured behind the clouds.

"Downstream. Toward where the river widens and seeks the sea. Westward."

"Finisterre," Sarah grasped. "The end of the known world."

"The *Costa da Morte*," Elías corrected, his voice deep. "The Priscillianists held that true soul liberation lay not in light, but in the hidden wisdom of shadows. We're not seeking a cathedral, Sarah. The map isn't leading us to Santiago. It's pulling us away."

A gust of wind swept through the valley, stirring the treetops and making the soaked clothes feel like ice against his skin. Elías hugged himself, feeling the cold settle deep in his core, a sensation surpassing the physical.

"The true path follows the dark stars," he whispered, watching the black water flow relentlessly beneath the bridge. "And it leads us straight to the ocean of the dead."

Sarah rose to her feet, offering a hand to help him up. Her grip was warm, the sole point of heat in a world that had turned gray and hostile.

"Then we'd best get moving before we freeze solid right here. If we're heading toward death, I prefer to arrive dry."

Elías nodded, accepting the assistance. As he limped back to the car, leaving a trail of water and grime, a question took shape in his mind, as heavy and dark as the river they had just disturbed: What sort of relic demands its devotees turn their backs on God to find it?

## Chapter 8: El Dragón de Piedra

CHAPTER 8 - The Stone Dragon

The SUV's engine had fallen silent an hour before, its roar now supplanted by the biting whistle of wind lashing the slopes of Pico Sacro. The mountain, a lone geological anomaly of white quartz, cast a jagged shadow across the Galician landscape, akin to the dorsal fin of a predator sunk in a sea of eucalyptus trees.

Elías Varela paused, hands braced on his knees, striving to quell his breathing, which rasped too loudly in the profound stillness. The chill from the Tambre River, though they had left Ponte Maceira behind, seemed to have lodged permanently in the marrow of his bones. It wasn't just the temperature; an insidious dampness turned his clothes, still wet beneath his coat, into a second, icy, heavy skin.

"Hypoxia won't help you think, Elías," Sarah Al-Fayed's voice drifted down from a few yards above him. No mockery laced her tone, only a clinical assessment of the situation.

She stood steady on a granite outcrop, her silhouette etched against a sky just beginning to stain a bruised violet, a herald of nightfall. Her stance was economical, conserving energy, while Elías felt each step a failed negotiation with gravity.

"It's not the lack of oxygen," he mumbled, straightening up and nudging his glasses with numb fingers; the gesture, so common in climate-controlled libraries, appeared pathetic in the open air. "It's the history of this place. Can you feel it? It weighs more than the very air."

Elías glanced up at the summit. The crystalline rock of Pico Sacro gleamed faintly, even in the wan light. According to the *Codex Calixtinus*, this was the scene of a deadly snare.

They resumed their climb. The path was nothing more than a goat-scar among gorse and thorny heather that snagged at the paleographer's corduroy trousers. As they gained elevation, the modern world melted into the valley below; the villages shrinking to inconsequential models, and time seemed to fold back upon itself.

Rounding a bend, where the rock formed a natural amphitheater shielded from the wind, they came upon the motionless form of a figure.

An elderly man, wrapped in a rough wool sheepskin coat and leaning on a hazel staff, watched a small flock of sheep graze the impossible between the stones. He showed no surprise at their appearance. His eyes, sunken within a network of wrinkles weathered by sun and rain, rested first on Sarah and then, with more scrutiny, on Elías.

"It's no time for climbing," the shepherd said. His voice rasped like gravel rolling down a slope. "The light is dying, and the Santa Compaña needs no lanterns."

Elías stepped forward, a jolt of academic curiosity eclipsing his physical exhaustion.

"We're looking for the cave, old man. The entrance to Queen Lupa's underworld."

The old man spat to one side. The gesture was dry, decisive.

"Lupa was no queen of men, but of stones." The shepherd indicated the summit with his chin, where a dark fissure gaped like an infected wound in the white rock. "They say she sent the disciples here for the dragon to devour them. But there are no dragons of flesh and blood, stranger. Only hunger. The mountain hungers."

"The dragon?" Sarah pressed, drawing closer. Her interest was not folkloric, but tactical.

"The stone that cuts. The fire that doesn't burn," the man replied, turning to follow a straying sheep. "What guards the path cannot be slain with swords. It is tamed with truth, or it swallows you whole."

Without further farewell, the shepherd melted into the rocks, blending with the surroundings as if he were just another granite outcropping.

Elías and Sarah exchanged a look. The art historian raised an eyebrow, prompting him to translate rural mysticism into actionable data.

"The *Liber Sancti Iacobi* recounts that Santiago's disciples asked Queen Lupa, a local pagan monarch, for a place to bury the Apostle," Elías explained as they resumed their ascent, his boots skidding occasionally on the quartz. "She sent them to this mountain, knowing it was guarded by a solar dragon. She hoped the beast would kill them. Instead, the disciples made the sign of the cross, and the dragon burst apart."

"Burst apart," Sarah repeated skeptically. "Convenient."

"Metaphorical," Elías corrected, gasping as he surmounted a particularly high rock step. "The Church always rewrites victory over older cults as a physical battle. But if the Codex we found in the river holds true, the 'sign of the cross' was no exorcism. It was a key."

They reached the cave entrance just as the sun surrendered on the horizon, leaving a bloody trail across the western clouds. The cavern's mouth exhaled a cold, mineral breath, an odor of wet earth and centuries of stagnant gloom.

Elías drew out his headlamp, but his hands trembled too much to adjust it properly. Sarah took it from him with a fluid motion, flicked on the beam, and settled it onto his forehead. The touch of her fingers, warm and firm, contrasted sharply with the chill of his own skin.

"Focus, Elías." Her voice was an imperative whisper. "Mind here. Now."

They entered.

The world shrank to the white cone of light sweeping the uneven walls. The acoustics shifted instantly; the howl of the outside wind gave way to the rhythmic, almost hypnotic, drip of seeping rainwater. *Plic. Plic. Plic.* A geological metronome, marking a pace far slower than human clocks.

The cave floor plunged sharply. Elías had to brace a hand on the wall to keep his balance. The rock felt viscous, coated in a bacterial slime.

"Here," Sarah said, stopping dead.

The beam from her own flashlight lit a rock formation at the center of a small natural chamber. At first glance, it appeared a crude altar: a horizontal slab resting on two vertical ones. A prehistoric dolmen caught in the mountain's guts.

Elías drew nearer, forgetting his weariness. His fingers, stained with ink, both imagined and real, traced the stone's contours.

"It's a Roman *ara*," he whispered, emotion tinting his voice with a reverent tone. "Reused."

He drew a crumpled handkerchief from his pocket and rubbed the granite surface. Beneath a layer of centuried moss, incisions emerged. They were not classic Latin letters. They were furious, deep lines.

"Look at this, Sarah."

She leaned in, her shoulder brushing his. The scent of ozone and rain that clung to her mingled with the cave's stale reek.

"A chrismon," she identified. "The symbol of Christ. Alpha and Omega."

"Yes, but look beneath it. The stone palimpsest."

Elías played his light across the relief at a shallow angle, etching long shadows that disclosed what the Christian chisel had sought to erase, but not entirely destroy. Beneath the chrismon, the rock displayed a different texture, a wavy, scaly pattern.

A serpent. Or a dragon.

"The Church built over paganism to stifle it," Elías said, his mind working at a dizzying pace, linking the points the shepherd had hinted at. "But here, they didn't stifle it. They integrated it."

"What does the dragon mean, Elías?" Sarah asked, playing her light over the rest of the cave. The walls glinted with veins of pure quartz. "If it's not a monster, what is it?"

Elías turned to the quartz wall. The lamplight fractured through the crystals, creating an effect of stars caught in the stone.

"Pico Sacro is almost entirely quartz," he murmured, as if speaking to himself. "Quartz possesses piezoelectric properties. In antiquity, this mountain must have shone under the full moon. Or during storms. For a culture that worshipped the stars, this wasn't a mountain. It was a beacon."

He cast his mind back for the heretical texts, the marginalia his academic colleagues disdained.

"The legend says the dragon blocked passage. Lupa sent the disciples to the dragon." Elías turned to Sarah, his grey eyes wide behind misted lenses. "The 'dragon' isn't a static guardian. It's a direction. It's the terrestrial *Via Lactea*."

He took out the leather cylinder guarding the parchment recovered from Ponte Maceira. With utmost care, he unrolled it upon the stone altar.

"The official Camino de Santiago runs East to West, following the sun to its demise. But the map we found..." He pointed to the inverted pentagram. "It reverses the logic."

"The dragon is the constellation of Draco," Sarah ventured, gazing at the cave ceiling as if she could perceive stars through the rock.

"No. It's more earthly." Elías gestured towards the quartz vein that coursed along the cave wall, appearing to plunge deep into the earth, pointing towards a specific direction. "In Celtic mythology, and pre-Celtic before that, mineral veins were the veins of the earth dragon. The ley lines. If we follow the 'dragon's spine,' the sacred geology the Church sought to Christianize with hermitages and monster legends..."

He tracked the quartz line with his finger. It pointed northwest. Not towards Santiago de Compostela.

"It points to the coast," Sarah finished. "To the Costa da Morte."

"Beyond Santiago," Elías corrected, feeling a vertigo unrelated to altitude. "The Apostle's tomb in the Cathedral... it's a decoy. A technical stop to divert ordinary pilgrims. The true knowledge, the secret the Priscillianists guarded, doesn't halt at Compostela. It traces the body of the stone dragon to the sea."

A dull thud, like a large stone shifting, echoed from the cave's mouth, distant, yet close to the surface.

Sarah extinguished her flashlight instantly. Her hand sought Elías's wrist and squeezed hard, silencing any protest.

"Someone's coming," she whispered, her voice barely a thread of air.

Elías felt his stomach clench into a knot. Total darkness descended again, save for the faint residual glow on his retinas. In that quiet, the drip of water now sounded like a countdown. They had deciphered the dragon, but now they were in its belly, and they were not the only ones who knew the way.

## CHAPTER 9 - Hunt in the Fog

The storm showed no mercy; the sky above Pico Sacro had caved in, turning the descent into a controlled tumble down a chute of mud and granite. Elías Varela's left leg no longer felt his own; the sharp ache from the previous chapter had transformed into a dull, sickening throb that crawled from his ankle to his groin with every step.

"Follow my lead," Sarah commanded, her voice barely audible over the roaring wind that whipped the eucalyptus crowns. No panic laced her tone, only a cold, military urgency.

Elías nodded, though she couldn't see him. He clung to the leather cylinder against his chest as if it were a liferaft in a shipwreck. His smooth-soled boots, inadequate for the terrain, slipped on the exposed roots that writhed like black veins beneath the layer of rotting leaves.

Sarah stopped short. She raised a clenched fist, a universal sign Elías recognized more by instinct than experience. The paleographer collided with her backpack, stifling a cry.

"Get down," she whispered, shoving him toward the base of a rock outcrop.

The forest, until then a cacophony of snapping branches and distant thunder, seemed to hold its breath. Then Elías heard it. Or rather, felt it. These were not human steps, heavy and uneven. It was a rhythmic movement, the sound of technical fabric rasping against the undergrowth, ascending toward them.

The Hunter was coming.

Sarah pointed to a vertical fissure in the quartz wall, a mountain's scar barely wide enough for two people. She pulled Elías into the darkness of the crack. The stone was icy, weeping ancient moisture. They pressed themselves together; the scent of Sarah's wet leather jacket mingled with the stale tang of Elías's soaked tweed.

Through the curtain of rain and mist, a silhouette took shape on the path they had just abandoned.

It was immense. The figure wore a long coat that seemed to absorb the meager moonlight filtered through the clouds. He moved with an economy of motion unnatural for a man of his size. But what chilled Elías to the bone was not the Pilgrim's physical presence, but what he held in his right hand.

It was no sword, no ritual dagger.

An electrical hum, sharp and constant, sliced the air. A bluish light, spectral and synthetic, illuminated Silas's scarred face from below. The assassin studied a touchscreen mounted on a robust, military-grade tracking device.

Elías felt his head swim. He had expected a medieval zealot, a living anachronism armed with blind faith and steel. But this monster used twenty-first-century technology to hunt heretics. The cognitive dissonance made him dizzy: archaic dogma guided by satellites.

Silas halted less than five meters from their hiding place. He lifted the device, sweeping the area with what Elías, in horror, realized was a thermal sensor.

The academic closed his eyes, squeezing his eyelids shut until sparks danced before his eyes, waiting for the scream, the shot, or the blow. *Pater noster, qui es in caelis...* The prayer sprang to mind, an atavistic reflex.

Sarah, however, did not pray. Her left hand sought Elías's and squeezed it with brutal force, anchoring him to reality, while her right hand gripped her knife in the darkness. Her breathing was so slow she seemed to have entered hibernation.

The quartz of Pico Sacro, cold and dense, must have been masking their heat signatures, or perhaps the torrential rain confused the sensors. Silas grunted, a guttural sound of frustration, and slapped the device against his thigh. He took a step toward the fissure.

Elías held his breath until his lungs burned.

Then, the hum of an incoming message vibrated in the tense silence. Silas glanced at the screen, read something that made him frown —the lack of eyebrows made the expression even more grotesque— and turned on his heel. With precise movements, he resumed his ascent toward the summit, moving away from them, convinced his prey were still seeking the altar high above.

Two full minutes passed before Sarah stirred.

"We have to go. Now." Her whisper cracked like a whip.

They emerged from the crack like exhumed ghosts. The descent became a frantic race against gravity. Elías no longer felt pain, only the certainty that death now had a postcode and GPS coordinates. They stumbled, fell, rose covered in mud, descending toward the faint, flickering lights that dotted the valley.

They reached the edge of a small farming village, barely a cluster of stone houses huddled against the hillside for shelter from the storm. A dog barked in the distance, a hoarse and weary sound.

"We need transport," Sarah said, scanning her surroundings with a predator's gaze.

"I don't have keys to..." Elías began, adjusting his damp spectacles with trembling hands.

"We don't need keys. We need something pre-1995. Nothing with complex electronics."

Sarah pointed to a corrugated iron shed where the blunt nose of a white van nosed out tentatively. A Citroën C15, the workhorse of rural Galicia, indestructible and omnipresent. The vehicle was covered in dust and straw, but the tires appeared to hold air.

They ran toward it, crouched low, avoiding the puddles that reflected the yellowish streetlights. Sarah tried the driver's door. Locked. She tried the passenger side. Also locked.

"Damn it," she muttered.

She drew her knife. Elías thought she would smash the window, which would have woken half the village, but she slid the thin blade between the window frame and the rubber seal, probing for the locking mechanism. Her movements were precise, born of necessity in conflict zone excavations where losing keys meant being stranded in the desert.

*Click.*

The latch sprang open. The sound ripped through the night's silence, obscenely loud.

They climbed in. The interior reeked of stale diesel, strong black tobacco, and feed sacks. Sarah slid under the steering wheel, ripping the plastic casing from the steering column with a dry snap.

"Light it up here," she commanded.

Elías switched on his headlamp, cupping his hand over the beam to soften its glare. He saw Sarah's dirt-stained fingers, separating a tangle of colored wires.

"Red is battery... black is ground..." she murmured, more to herself than to him. She stripped the ends with her teeth, spitting out the plastic. "Come on, old girl, wake up."

She joined two wires. A blue spark jumped, briefly illuminating her tense features. The starter motor coughed, an agonized, metallic groan.

"Come on," she urged.

Elías looked out the rear window. On the mountainside, a man-made light hurtled down. Silas had realized his mistake. The hunter was descending, and this time he wouldn't stop to consult screens.

"Sarah..." Elías's voice was a thread of anguish.

"I know!"

She joined the wires again. The engine churned, coughed a cloud of black smoke that Elías could smell even inside the cabin, and finally roared to life with a deafening diesel clatter that made the entire chassis vibrate.

Sarah jammed the van into first gear without fully depressing the clutch, provoking a grind of gears that made Elías's teeth ache. The van lurched and shot onto the rural road, skidding on the wet gravel.

She didn't switch on the headlights until they were a kilometer away, taking blind bends guided only by intuition and fear. When the yellow beams finally sliced through the gloom, they revealed a tunnel of oaks arching above them.

Elías slumped against the sagging, spring-worn seatback digging into his spine. He clutched the leather cylinder. They were alive. For now.

He looked at Sarah. Her jaw was clenched, knuckles white on the steering wheel, driving as if the devil himself nipped at their heels. And in a way, Elías thought as the adrenaline receded, giving way to exhaustion, he was right. But this devil carried no trident; he used a satellite tracker.

"Where to?" she asked, her gaze fixed on the ribbon of asphalt.

Elías looked at the parchment protected inside the cylinder. The answer wasn't on any official map. The answer lay where the stars died.

"West," he said, his voice finding a resolve he did not feel. "To the Costa da Morte. Where the stone bleeds."

The C15 accelerated, disappearing into the Galician night, leaving behind the sacred mountain and the predator who, Elías was sure, was already seeking his own transport to resume the hunt.

## Chapter 10: El Código de las Estrellas

{
  "translated_text": "CHAPTER 10: The Star Code\n\nThe old C15 van's wiper fought a losing battle against the deluge, setting a grating rhythm that frayed nerves. Elías Varela stared into the void through the fogged glass, feeling each rut in the country road jolt through him like an electric shock, climbing from his ankle to the base of his skull. The flight from Pico Sacro had been a blur of wet asphalt and liquid dread, but the body demanded its due.\n\n\"There,\" Sarah pointed, her voice hoarse with tension.\n\nOn the right, a neon sign, half its letters missing, flickered agonisingly: *M TEL R TA 6*. The building was a concrete block from the seventies, eaten away by damp and neglect, its blind windows like hollowed-out sockets. It resembled an architectural cadaver abandoned in the middle of nowhere, perfect for two fugitives who wished to elude electronic eyes.\n\nSarah cut the engine, and darkness swallowed the world whole, leaving only the ceaseless drumming of rain on the metal roof.\n\n\"Can you walk?\" she asked, turning to him. The greenish glow of the dashboard illuminated her hard features, deepening the dark circles beneath her black eyes.\n\n\"My body's mechanics suggest otherwise,\" Elías whispered, attempting to move his right leg. A dead weight, like molten lead, pinned his limb to the vehicle's floor. It wasn't a sharp ache, but a dense pressure, a tide of unhealthy heat threatening to overwhelm his senses.\n\nSarah offered no empty reassurances. She stepped out into the storm, circled the vehicle, and opened the passenger door. Cold, damp air struck Elías's face, carrying the scent of wet earth and pine. He leaned on the historian's shoulder, which tautened under his weight, rigid as a granite caryatid, unyielding.\n\nThey entered room number 4 after forcing the rusted lock with Sarah's knife. The interior smelled of confinement, decades of settled dust, and rotting wood. Elías collapsed onto the bare mattress, whose springs groaned in protest.\n\n\"Light,\" he requested, fumbling in his pockets. His hand brushed against the leather cylinder of the Codex, instinctively checking it was still there. This tactile obsession was the sole thing that kept his mind tethered.\n\nSarah switched on her headlamp, casting a cone of white light that sliced through the gloom. She knelt before him and tore the fabric of his corduroy trousers with her knife. Elías gritted his teeth, averting his gaze to the damp stains on the ceiling, lest he see the exposed flesh.\n\n\"It's swollen,\" she diagnosed in a clinical tone, though her fingers moved with a gentleness that belied her words. \"No open fracture, but the ligament is compromised. You need ice, but a compression bandage will have to do.\"\n\nWhile she worked with shreds of an old T-shirt from her backpack, the silence thickened between them. It wasn't an empty silence, but one laden with unspoken words about what they'd seen on the mountain: Silas's lethal technology, the relentless nature of his pursuit.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Elías murmured. Guilt, that old specter always hounding him, solidified in his throat. \"I'm a burden. A library academic has no place in this war. You should have left me in the car.\"\n\nSarah paused her hands. She looked up, and the beam from her headlamp temporarily blinded Elías, forcing him to close his eyes.\n\n\"Look at me, Varela,\" she commanded. He obeyed, blinking behind the grimy lenses of his spectacles. \"You deciphered the altarpiece's mechanism. You comprehended the inscription. I just drive and hit things. Without your mind, I'm a wanderer. Without my legs, you're a brain in a jar. We are a single, functioning organism. Understood?\"\n\nThe woman's brutal candor served as a balm, more effective than any medicine. Elías nodded, feeling the knot in his diaphragm ease a fraction. He removed his spectacles, leaving them on the dusty bedside table. Without them, the world blurred into a diffuse watercolor of shadows and light, and Sarah became a warm, nearby blur.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said, barely a whisper.\n\n\"Save your thanks for when we survive.\" She finished the bandage knot and rose to her feet, dusting off her hands. \"Now, to work. Where do we go? Silas will comb the area. If we stay put, his thermal birds will find us before dawn.\"\n\nElías retrieved his spectacles, and with them, his focus. Sharpness returned to the world, and with it, urgency.\n\n\"The parchment,\" he said, reaching for the leather cylinder. \"I need flat light and a surface.\"\n\nSarah cleared the Formica table, sweeping a cheap glass ashtray to the floor. Elías drew forth the document with the reverence of one who handles a sacred relic. As he unrolled it, the leather crackled, a dry sound that seemed to echo in the empty walls.\n\nUnder the harsh glare of the flashlight, the twelfth-century map appeared to quicken with life. The lines of iron-gall ink, oxidized by time to a reddish hue, delineated a geography Elías knew by heart, yet one that now felt alien, uncanny.\n\n\"We have this,\" Sarah said, drawing from her jacket a folding road map she'd salvaged from the glove compartment of the stolen van. She spread it beside the parchment. \"Galicia road map, 1998 edition. As antiquated as this motel, but the physical geography hasn't changed.\"\n\nElías scrutinized both documents. To the left, modern cartographic precision; to the right, medieval mystic interpretation. His eyes darted between them, seeking the pattern, the link his intuition screamed existed.\n\n\"The *Iter Stellarum*,\" Elías murmured, rubbing his temple, where a migraine began to hammer. \"Legend says the Way mirrors the Milky Way. Field of Stars. *Campus Stellae*. Santiago.\"\n\n\"That's what the tourist brochures say,\" Sarah countered, leaning over the table, her braid falling across the paper. \"But the Codex speaks of a 'true path.' Of dark stars.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\" Elías traced with an index finger, stained with imaginary ink, the line of the Camino Francés on the modern map. \"The Milky Way flows east to west. But look at the parchment. The landmarks... the abbeys, the cruceiros, the milestones emblazoned with the astrolabe symbol... they do not follow a straight line.\"\n\nHis finger moved over the parchment, connecting the red-inked points. The resulting line was no direct route, but a winding, serpentine curve that plunged southward before sweeping sharply back toward the northwest.\n\n\"It looks like a river,\" Sarah observed, frowning. \"A meander.\"\n\nThe word exploded in Elías's mind like a silent supernova. *River*.\n\n\"Not the Milky Way,\" he whispered, feeling his blood thrum in his ears, drowning out the rain's drumming. \"The Milky Way is the path of souls in popular tradition. But the heretics, the Priscillianists... they looked to other stars. They looked to the underworld.\"\n\nElías delved into his encyclopedic memory, turning mental pages of ancient astronomical treatises. His hands trembled, not from cold, but from the electric charge of discovery.\n\n\"Eridanus,\" he said with conviction. \"The River constellation.\"\n\nSarah looked at him, awaiting elucidation.\n\n\"In Greek mythology, Eridanus is the river into which Phaeton fell when he lost control of the sun chariot. It's a river that links the world of the living to Hades.\" Elías took the pen from Sarah's cargo pocket and, without hesitation, began to sketch on the 1998 road map. \"If we overlay the Eridanus constellation onto Galicia, taking Pico Sacro as the star *Cursa*, the river's source...\"\n\nElías drew. The line started from Pico Sacro, descended south, touching points that seemed unremarkable on the road map, and then curved, twisting like a wounded serpent toward the coast.\n\n\"Look,\" Elías pointed, his voice gaining power, the pain in his leg forgotten. \"Each star in the constellation corresponds to a pre-Christian sacred site the Church had tried to efface. Castro de Baroña... the Dolmen of Dombate...\"\n\n\"And where does it end?\" Sarah asked, her dark eyes fixed on the blue ink trace.\n\nElías guided the pen to the end of the sinuous line. The Eridanus constellation finished at a luminous star, the brightest in the southern sky.\n\n\"Achernar,\" Elías pronounced. The name tasted of dust and enigma on his tongue.\n\nHis pen tip paused on the Atlantic coast, at a point where the land tore itself against the ocean. It was not Finisterre, the official end. It was farther north, wilder.\n\n\"Muxía,\" Sarah read. \"The Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Boat.\"\n\n\"Rocking stones. Lithic cults predating Rome.\" Elías looked up from the map. His mind, previously fogged by exhaustion, now blazed with geometric clarity. \"Silas believes we're fleeing aimlessly. But if we follow the river, if we follow Eridanus... we are not fleeing. We are pilgrimaging toward the original source.\"\n\nSarah perused the map, calculating distances, times, logistics. Her face hardened, reassuming the strategist's mantle.\n\n\"It's the Costa da Morte,\" she said. \"Tricky terrain. Cliffs, wind, and scant main roads. Perfect for disappearing. But if Silas has the same knowledge...\"\n\n\"He doesn't,\" Elías interjected with uncommon certainty. \"He is an executor, a zealot of dogma. For him, the heavens are immutable. He wouldn't seek truth in a river leading to hell.\"\n\nA distant peal of thunder rattled the room's windows, as if the sky sought to underscore his pronouncements. Elías felt an odd calm. Physical fear still lurked, crouching in the pit of his stomach, but now he had purpose. The map was no longer a labyrinth; it was an arrow.\n\nSarah folded the road map with dry, precise movements, stowing it in her pocket. Then, she regarded Elías.\n\n\"Achernar. The End of the River.\" She nodded, just once. \"Rest two hours, Varela. Then we set out. We need to reach the ocean before that 'pilgrim' decides to descend his mountain.\"\n\nElías lay back again, feeling exhaustion claim its due. But before closing his eyes, he looked one last time toward the blind window. Beyond, past the storm clouds, the stars charted paths only they could discern. For the first time since this ordeal began, Elías felt not like prey, but rather as an initiate.\n\nThe celestial river awaited them.",

## CHAPTER 11: Echoes of Priscilian

The old C15’s engine gave a metallic wheeze before succumbing to silence, parking beneath the long shadow of the yew trees. The journey from Negreira had been a nauseating succession of bends, windshield wipers barely contending with the ceaseless drizzle—that Galician mist, which didn't fall so much as drift, soaking the soul before it ever touched the clothes.

Sarah's hands remained clenched tight on the steering wheel, knuckles stark white, betraying a tension her stony face refused to yield. Beside her, Elías, in the passenger seat, worked a crumpled cloth handkerchief. He rubbed the lenses of his glasses with a frantic, almost painful rhythm. The relentless damp had seeped into the cabin, clouding his lenses and, perhaps, his judgment.

"Iria Flavia," Elías murmured, settling his spectacles. The world instantly regained its sharp, clear edges. "The ancient episcopal seat. If stones could speak anywhere on this earth, it would surely be here."

"Let's hope the living are more forthcoming," Sarah replied, scanning the perimeter using the rearview mirrors. Her dark eyes searched for anything amiss—metallic glints, static figures. "Remember the plan. We are academics from the University of Salamanca, documenting pre-Romanesque architecture. No star charts, no heresies."

Elías nodded, pulling up his scarf, trying to conceal the collar of his shirt, already soiled with mud and dried sweat. The air, as they stepped from the vehicle, smelled of freshly turned earth and cypress—a sweet, heavy scent that clung to the palate, almost chewable.

The Adina cemetery was not a place of repose, but an untidy archive spanning centuries. Suevian granite sarcophagi shared space with nineteenth-century headstones, crafting a chronological jumble where death stood as the sole constant. They walked upon the tall grass, carefully avoiding the flagstones crusted with orange lichen. The Collegiate Church of Santa María loomed before them, stark and imposing, bearing the silent dignity of structures that had weathered fires and pillage.

"Over there," Sarah indicated with a subtle nod.

An old man, bent like a question mark, plucked weeds beside a neo-Gothic mausoleum. He wore a cassock frayed at the edges, stained with damp earth at the knees. He seemed not a priest, but a gardener who had aged at the same pace as the trees.

Elías stepped forward, forcing an upright posture his back protested.

"*Pax vobis*," he greeted in Latin, as one might present credentials.

The old man ceased his work. He turned his neck slowly; it groaned like a rusty hinge. Donato’s milky eyes widened immensely, and for an instant, the gardener vanished, making way for the guardian.

"Peace is a luxury Iria Flavia has not known since the Normans came up the estuary, son," the priest's voice scraped like stone dragged across gravel. "I am Father Donato. What do you seek among those who are no longer in a hurry?"

"Knowledge, Father," Elías pulled a notebook from his jacket, careful not to reveal the leather cylinder tucked against his chest. "We're studying the iconography of the capitals. We're tracing signs of... unconventional influences along the primitive Jacobean route."

Donato let out a dry chuckle, a puff that barely stirred the air. He wiped his hands on his cassock, leaving twin smears of dark mud.

"'Unconventional.' That's a genteel way of naming an unpalatable truth," the priest leaned on a hoe. "You are not from Salamanca. You have the mud of the Costa da Morte on your boots and fear in your eyes. Salamanca smells of old paper; you smell of storm."

Sarah tensed, her right hand hovering near the knife in her pocket, but Elías raised a calming palm. The academic lie would not serve here. This man lived among the dead; he could read secrets.

Elías changed tactics. He opened his notebook to a specific page. There, he'd sketched, with a trembling hand during their journey, the figure they'd isolated from the overlaid star map: a jagged line that didn't align with the Milky Way, but rather with the Eridanus constellation, the River of Heaven, inverted, ending in a dark spot.

"We aren't looking for influences," Elías whispered, lowering his voice so the wind wouldn't snatch the words. "We're looking for the beheaded Bishop."

The effect was immediate. The air around Donato seemed to ice over. He let go of the hoe; it dropped onto the grass with a muffled thud. Donato’s milky eyes widened immeasurably, and for an instant, the gardener faded, giving way to the guardian.

"Keep that hidden," he hissed, glancing toward the cemetery walls with overt paranoia. "Here, the walls have ears, and the yew trees hold memory."

"The map points here, and then it continues," Elías pressed on, adrenaline hammering at his temples. "Official history states the Cathedral's body belongs to the Apostle. But the markings... the dates of the transfer..."

"Silence!" Donato stepped forward, seizing Elías by his jacket lapel with astonishing strength. His fingers dug in like talons. "Do you comprehend what you summon? For a thousand years, we have built a cathedral upon a pious fabrication to uphold the faith of a continent. Saint James the Moor-Slayer. The Son of Thunder. Yet the earth... the earth knows whom it embraces."

The priest released Elías and crossed himself, a swift, superstitious gesture, not liturgical.

"Priscilian," Sarah whispered. The name drifted among the graves like a conjured phantom.

Donato nodded slightly, his chin trembling.

"The first heretic executed by the Church. The bishop who preached with women, read the stars, declared the body a temple, not these cold stones." The old man spat onto the ground. "His disciples brought him here in secret. They buried him where the stars charted the world's end, not where Rome decreed. Iria Flavia was the first stop, but not the last."

"Where?" Elías asked. The paleographer's mind slotted pieces into place with dizzying speed. The 'error' in medieval maps, the detours from the French route... they weren't errors. They were amendments designed to conceal the original pilgrimage.

Donato looked to the west, where the sky darkened with leaden clouds.

"The Wolves of God always watch," he murmured, his voice cracking. "Men without faces, with the cross for a sword. They have been here. Two days past. They asked after scrolls, after strangers."

Elías and Sarah exchanged an electric gaze. The Pilgrim. Silas.

"Father, we need to know where they took him," Sarah insisted, drawing nearer. Her tone was no longer that of a scholar, but of a firm protector. "If those men find what they seek, they will lay waste to what you guard."

The old man delved into the folds of his cassock and produced an old lead medal, smoothed by generations of touch. It bore the etching of an ark, though not Noah's. It was a stone boat without a rudder.

"Saint James is the theater. It is the stage erected for the masses," Donato said, placing the medal in Elías's hand. The metal felt faintly hot to the touch. "But if you crave the truth, you must follow the water, not the stone. Find the place where the estuary becomes a tomb. Search in Noia."

"Noia?" Elías repeated, inspecting the lead disk.

"The *Portus Apostoli*," the priest explained, retrieving his hoe and resuming his work with mechanical motions, as if wishing to erase the conversation. "They say Noah founded the town, but heresy maintains the beheaded body disembarked there before being hidden in the forest. In the Church of San Martiño de Noia... seek the tombstone that bears no name, only a fallen star."

A crow's caw rent the silence. Sarah spun around. Far off, on the road skirting the graveyard, a black vehicle slowed, its tinted windows mirrored the leaden sky's gray, cloaking the interior from view.

"Leave at once," Donato ordered, without looking up from the hydrangeas. "Forget you ever saw me. I am just an old man who speaks with the flowers. And pray... not to Saint James, but to whoever truly listens from the abyss."

Elías pocketed the medal in the same pocket as the cylinder. The medal's weight was trivial compared to the revelation's crushing burden: the prospect that Western Christendom had pilgrimaged for a millennium to the tomb of a heretic, not a saint.

"Let's go," Sarah said, seizing Elías by the arm. Her grip was firm, urgent.

They walked back to the van. An invisible, yet perceptible, gaze bored into their necks. It wasn't the priest's, but a physical sensation, a pressure at the base of his skull that Elías knew well: the chilling certainty of being quarry.

As they entered the vehicle, the rain intensified, turning the windshield into a cascade. The C15's engine roared, sounding obscenely loud in the burial ground's quietude.

"Noia is thirty kilometers from here," Sarah said, shifting into first gear with abrupt force. "If we cut through the mountains."

"The Wolves of God..." Elías murmured, wiping his glasses again, though this time cold sweat, not rain, clouded his vision. "Silas's Order. We aren't the only ones who can read the map, Sarah. They already know the truth isn't in Compostela."

"Then we have to get there first," she declared.

The van skidded lightly on the wet gravel as it pulled onto the road, leaving Iria Flavia and its buried secrets behind. As the landscape blurred into green and gray smears, Elías gazed at the lead medal he still held. History re-wrote itself with every kilometer they advanced, and the ground beneath their feet—the sacred earth of Galicia—all at once felt far less solid, as if they trod upon an ocean of lies poised to swallow them whole.

The question hung in the cabin's stale air, unspoken yet deafening: If Saint James isn't Saint James, what else is a sham?

Sarah pressed the accelerator. Their destination was Noia. The hunt was on.

## Chapter 12: La Villa de las Lápidas

CHAPTER: 12 - The Town of Gravestones

The old C15 van's wiper waged a losing battle against the deluge, groaning rhythmically as it swept away the water blurring the coastal road. This was no vertical rain; it was a dense, almost solid curtain, driven by Atlantic squalls that turned the thirty-kilometer journey between Padrón and the estuary into a blind traverse.

Elías Varela clung to the door handle, knuckles white. The rattling diesel engine and battered suspension made clear thought impossible, yet adrenaline kept his mind humming, a constant tremor. Sarah drove with fierce competence, her dark eyes riveted to the gleaming asphalt, anticipating each bend with the precision of one who plots force vectors.

“We’re almost there,” she announced, her voice slicing through the ambient din. “The sign pointed to the historic center.”

Before them, beneath the Galician afternoon’s molten lead sky, Noia materialized. The town seemed not to welcome them, but merely to tolerate their presence. Elías wiped the mist from his window with his tweed jacket sleeve.

“*Portus Apostoli*,” he murmured, watching the slate roofs gleam like fish scales. “But official history lies. It’s not just the port. According to heresy, this is ‘Little Santiago.’ A dark mirror of Compostela, crafted not for glory, but for safekeeping.”

Sarah slowed the van as they entered the cobbled streets, where the tires thrummed a deep tattoo.

“Safekeeping for what?”

“Of lineage. Of blood.” Elías gestured toward the imposing Gothic silhouette dominating Tapal Square. “Saint Martin’s Church. They say Noia was founded by Noah, or by his granddaughter Noela. It is the city of the Ark. If Compostela is the tomb, Noia is the vessel that allows survival of the deluge. Here is where what cannot die is kept safe.”

They parked on a poorly lit corner, away from prying eyes. The air that greeted them outside the vehicle had a salty tang, a blend of marsh and wet stone. Elías adjusted his scarf, feeling the damp chill instantly penetrate his bones. He carried his notebook tucked under his arm, as if it were an external vital organ.

They walked toward the church. The structure, consecrated in 1434, stood with a single tower, lending it a mutilated, asymmetrical appearance that disturbed the paleographer. But it wasn't the edifice they sought, but the ground around it.

Saint Martin's medieval cemetery was no ordinary graveyard. It was a lithic library, an ordered chaos of stacked and scattered guild gravestones, forming an uneven pavement telling the stories of a thousand anonymous dead.

“Good Lord,” Sarah exhaled, sweeping the area with the beam of her headlamp. The sun was yielding, and shadows stretched the granite shapes. “There are hundreds.”

“More than five hundred,” Elías corrected, advancing cautiously over the slick flagstones. “It's the largest concentration of guild gravestones in Europe. Scissors for the tailor, hammers for the smith, fish for the mariner. There are no names, Sarah. Only symbols. It’s a perfect visual identification system for an illiterate populace.”

“And what exactly are we looking for?” she asked, crouching to examine a slab displaying a crudely carved anchor.

“An anomaly.” Elías drew the parchment from the leather cylinder, shielding it from the drops with his body. “The Iria Flavia clue mentioned the ‘Navigating Star.’ It cannot be a common guild mark. It must be something that links sky and sea. An astrolabe, a primitive sextant... or the Ark itself beneath a constellation.”

They separated, moving through the stone labyrinth. The place had deceptive acoustics; the wind hissed between the buttresses, and gargoyles seemed to spit water with deliberate malice. Elías felt the weight of history beneath his rubber soles. Each stride a desecration. The gravestones lay scattered like cards from a giant’s frustrated hand, overlapping, some fractured, others consumed by neon green velvet moss.

“Elías!” Sarah’s whisper was urgent, clipped. “We have company.”

The paleographer froze. A hundred feet away, near the north entrance of the churchyard, three figures stood silhouetted against the distant streetlamp’s sickly yellow glow. They did not appear to be the Order’s professionals. They moved with the loutish swagger of local youths, sharing a bottle and harsh laughter. “Thugs,” Elías thought. Village toughs looking for trouble.

“Turn off your light,” he hissed, melting into the gray gloom.

“They’re blocking the main exit,” Sarah assessed, her voice taking on the tactical edge Elías was beginning to know. “We have to find the gravestone fast and exit via the west wall.”

The pressure of time turned the academic search into a frantic hunt. Elías advanced, bent low, his fingers brushing the cold, wet carvings. *Scissors. Footwear. An axe. A fleury cross.* Nothing. Panic began to crawl up his throat. If the Order reached Noia, these local boys would be collateral damage, and they, corpses.

His eyes, myopic and strained behind fogged lenses, caught a distinct pattern in an elevated section, where the gravestones had been stacked upright against the church wall to create room.

He approached, squinting. The stone was blackened by centuries of exposure, but the carving was deep. It was no tradesman’s tool. It was a complex circle, intersected by lines that depicted not earthly objects, but angles.

“Sarah,” he called in a thin whisper, not daring to use the flashlight. “Here.”

She appeared at his side like a denser shadow.

“Got it?”

“Look.” Elías traced the shape with his index finger. “It’s not a stonemason’s compass. It’s a simplified nautical astrolabe. And down here…” he scraped away the lichen with his fingernail, “waves. Water. And a stylized boat. It’s the confluence. Sky and ocean. Noia’s Ark.”

“Make the tracing. I’ll watch the locals. They’re coming this way.”

Elías nodded, drawing the rice paper and graphite stick from his pocket. The gravestone was in an awkward spot, five feet off the ground, atop an unstable stack of discarded sarcophagi. He would have to clamber over two lower slabs to reach the right angle.

He planted a foot on the base stone. The wet granite offered as much purchase as oil-slicked ice. He pushed himself up, his left hand seeking balance while his right prepared the paper.

“Hey! Who’s there?” The guttural and challenging cry shattered the hallowed stillness. A glass bottle smashed against the wall mere feet away, erupting in a shower of shards.

Elías flinched. It was an instinctive movement, a defensive muscle spasm. His supporting foot, clad in a worn-soled shoe, lost all grip on the soaked moss.

The world spun.

There was no time for fear, only for unyielding physics. His body fell backward, but his right foot caught fast in a crevice between two heavy sarcophagi. The leg became a lever; his body's weight, the hammer.

A dry, sickening crack echoed. Like a green branch snapped with brutal force. An organic and structural noise that echoed inside his own skull louder than thunder.

Elías slammed against the muddy ground on his back, the air rushing from his lungs in a choked gasp.

“Elías!” Sarah was at his side in an instant, her stealth abandoned.

For a moment, Elías’s brain refused to process the signal. There was a void, a white silence. And then, reality demanded its due.

The pain wasn't sharp at first; it was a tide of molten rock that surged from ankle to hip, erasing all other thought. An electric lash that arched his back and clenched his teeth until his jawbone grated.

“My leg!” he gasped, trying to sit up, but the slightest movement sent jolts of pure agony clouding his vision. “Oh, God!”

Sarah switched on her flashlight, aiming it downwards. Elías’s right foot rested at an unnatural angle, twisted outwards in a way human anatomy could not permit without catastrophic consequence. His ankle was visibly swelling, straining the shoe's leather.

“Don’t move,” she ordered, her face pale under the artificial light. She spun toward the voices of the thugs, who were running closer, drawn by the clamor. “We have to go. Now.”

“I can’t…” Elías felt the bile rising. Cold sweat mingled with rain on his forehead. “I think it’s broken. I heard it.”

“You’ll have to.”

Sarah slipped an arm around his waist and hauled him upright. Elías’s scream was muffled by her palm clamping over his mouth.

“Quiet, and walk. If they find us now, we’re done for. Lean on me. All your weight.”

Elías nodded, tears of pain mingling with the rain. He hopped on his good leg. When he tried to put even the slightest weight on his right, his knee gave out, and the world blackened at the edges. It was an architectural pain, the collapse of foundations.

“The gravestone…” he mumbled, obsession warring with shock.

“I’ve memorized it. Come on!”

Dragging himself like a wounded beast, draped over Sarah’s shoulder, Elías Varela left Noia’s cemetery behind. Each step was torture, each meter an impossible conquest. He was no longer merely an academic on a theoretical quest. Now, he was a burden. A broken man in a race that had just taken a lethally physical turn.

## Chapter 13: Sangre en el Granito

CAPÍTULO: 13 - Blood on the Granite

The C15's engine coughed its last before dying at the wooden gate, overcome by mud and exertion. No streetlights illuminated that bend in the back road, only the utter darkness of rural Galicia, a thick gloom that seemed to swallow the headlights' glow.

Elías Varela made no move. His right leg was no longer a limb, but an incandescent granite block tethered to his hip. The vehicle's vibrations had ceased, yet the pain continued sending seismic waves up his spine.

"Don't move," Sarah ordered, her voice tight, vying with the rain drumming on the metal roof.

She stepped out into the downpour. Elías watched her through the misted windshield, a silhouette stark against distant lightning flashes, pounding on the house door with a clenched fist. She wasn't knocking; she was demanding entry.

A minute later, a yellow light flickered on the porch. A short woman, of stocky build and short, greying hair, opened the door. She wore a work smock over her pajamas and cradled a sawed-off shotgun in the crook of her arm. Elías instinctively swiped the condensation from his glasses with his thumb, though the action proved futile from his vantage.

A swift exchange ensued. Sarah didn't flinch from the weapon. She gestured toward the van. The woman lowered the barrel, spat on the ground, and nodded grudgingly.

Sarah returned, opened the passenger door, and the smell of damp earth flooded the cabin, displacing the stale, confined scent of old sweat.

"It's Marta," she said, slipping Elías's arm over her shoulders. "I told you the Lugo dig proved useful for more than just unearthing Roman coins. Come on. Lean on me. All your weight, Elías. Don't play the hero."

The ten-meter trek to the entrance became a muddy ordeal. Each step sent a searing electric jolt from Elías's ankle to the base of his skull. His teeth chattered, not from cold, but from the strain of stifling a cry.

They entered a spacious room, with worn hydraulic tiles underfoot and walls lined with metal shelving. The scent was unmistakable: alcohol, iodine, and that animal musk that permeates farmyards. This was no hospital for humans. At its center, a stainless steel table, built to bear the weight of mastiffs and calves, gleamed beneath the harsh fluorescent lights.

"To the table," Marta instructed, securing the door with three bolts. "And don't mess up my floor any more than you have to."

Elías was hoisted onto the metal surface. The steel's cold pierced his soaked clothing, sending a spasm through his back. He felt ludicrously out of place, a tweed-clad academic, full of old books, sprawled where livestock were routinely gelded.

Marta approached without ceremony. Her hands were large, red, weather-beaten from winters spent outdoors. There was no gentleness in them, only raw capability.

"Pants off," she ordered, searching for pruning shears in a drawer.

Sarah helped Elías unbuckle his belt. The shame of exposure dissolved before the medical urgency. When the damp corduroy slid away, the leg's condition lay exposed beneath the stark white light.

Elías forced himself to look. It wasn't pretty. The original wound, poorly healed and strained by their flight, had ripped open. Its edges were inflamed, a purplish red that clashed sickly with his pale, academic skin. Dirt was ingrained in the gash.

Marta let out a low whistle.

"Nasty mess. Barbed wire?"

"Something like that," Sarah lied, settling herself at the head of the table, bracing Elías's shoulders.

"I have horse xylazine and local lidocaine," the vet said, filling a syringe with clear fluid. "The xylazine will leave him groggy, but if you're in a hurry to leave, I don't recommend it. It will take him hours to find his footing."

"No general sedatives," Elías responded, his voice a rasping whisper. He needed a clear head. The Codex, the Noia inscription, *Finis Terrae*... he couldn't afford the chemical fog. "Just local."

Marta gave him an appraising look, recalibrating her assessment of the scrawny man before her.

"Suit yourself. It's going to smart when I clean it. This isn't public healthcare, sweetheart. Here, we scrape to the bone."

The first prick of local anesthetic was a wasp sting. Elías closed his eyes and clenched his teeth until his jaw ached. Sarah leaned over him, her face inches from his.

"Look at me, Elías," she commanded. Her dark eyes served as anchors in the approaching storm of pain. "Don't look at the leg. Focus on the inscription. What does *Sanguis* mean in the context of the map?"

Marta began her work. The stiff-bristled brush scoured the raw flesh. Elías arched his back, a groan escaped his throat despite his best efforts. His fingers dug into the metal edge of the table, seeking to warp the steel.

"The... the circulatory system," Elías gasped, clinging to Sarah's question like a lifeline. "The *rías*... they're veins. The earth's blood."

"Keep talking," Sarah whispered, sweeping a damp strand of hair from his forehead. Her hand was warm, a vital contrast against his cold skin.

"The granite... it bleeds rusted iron... it looks like blood. The Star isn't in the sky... it's below."

Marta worked with mechanical precision. She debrided dead tissue, irrigated with saline, and began to suture. The curved needle passed through the skin with a damp *ploc, ploc* sound, like stitching thick leather. Elías felt the tugs, a queasy pressure that churned his stomach.

"Almost done," the vet announced, snipping the thread with a sharp click.

Elías dropped his head against the table, sweat soaking his shirt. The sharp pain had softened into a dull, steady throb, but the sensation of liquid fire had receded.

Marta stepped back, peeling off her crimson-stained latex gloves. She walked to a sink in the corner and turned on a small portable television resting on a stack of canine magazines, seeking background noise to lighten the oppressive atmosphere.

The regional newscast was in its final minutes. The grainy image flickered and showed a photograph that chilled Sarah's blood faster than the Galician rain.

It was a five-year-old passport photo of Elías, sporting a bewildered academic expression. Alongside it, a blurred surveillance image of Sarah, entering the Cathedral.

The caption scrolling below read: *ACTIVE SEARCH: DESECRATION AND KIDNAPPING.*

The announcer's voice filled the clinic:
"...authorities request public assistance. The Archbishopric, through its spokesperson Monsignor Camiña, has expressed profound concern for the safety of Doctor Al-Fayed, allegedly held against her will by former curator Elías Varela, prime suspect in the acts of vandalism against Compostela's heritage. A reward of fifty thousand euros is offered for information leading to their whereabouts..."

The silence that followed in the clinic was heavier than granite.

Marta turned slowly. She held a gauze pad in her hand, but her eyes sought the shotgun she had propped by the door.

"Kidnapping," Marta said. It was not a question.

Sarah straightened, releasing Elías's shoulders. She subtly placed herself between the veterinarian and the operating table.

"Turn that off, Marta."

"Fifty thousand euros," the vet murmured, looking at Elías with a mix of disbelief and calculation. "You told me you were running from thugs over your friend's gambling debt. You didn't tell me you had the Church and the Guardia Civil hot on your heels. Or that you were the one being kidnapped."

"I'm not kidnapped," Sarah said, stepping forward, displaying empty palms but holding tension in her leg muscles. "Look at me. Do I look like a victim?"

"You look like you're tangled in a mess that's going to splash all over me," Marta retorted, backing towards the wall-mounted landline. "My clinic is unlicensed, Sarah. If they find me harboring a terrorist..."

"He's not a terrorist," Elías cut in from the table. He tried to sit up, but dizziness forced him back down. His voice trembled, but it held a steel-like clarity. "He's a scapegoat. And Camiña... Camiña doesn't want to rescue Sarah. He wants to silence her."

Marta lifted the receiver. The dial tone pierced the silent room.

"Marta, listen to me," Sarah's voice dropped an octave, turning hard, authoritative. It was the voice she used commanding teams on hostile digs. "That money is blood money. If you call, the Guardia Civil won't come. They will. The men who did that to Elías's leg."

"It's a lot of money, Sarah. And I have real debts."

"Remember who scrubbed your name from the reports when the excavation collapsed in Lugo?" Sarah launched the question like a dart. "Who took responsibility for the structural failure so you could keep practicing?"

Marta's hand froze over the keypad.

"That was a decade ago."

"Loyalty doesn't expire," Sarah insisted, closing the distance. She placed her hand over the receiver, covering her friend's fingers. "Camiña is the man erasing history. He's twisting faith to conceal his crimes. If you hand us over, they'll kill us before we ever reach the station. And you'll have to live knowing you sold your only friend for thirty pieces of silver... adjusted for inflation."

The veterinarian's gaze darted between the television screen, where Elías's photo remained fixed, and Sarah's unyielding face. The sound of the rain outside seemed to intensify, severing the building from the rational world outside.

Slowly, Marta replaced the receiver.

The air escaped Elías's lungs in a shaky exhalation.

"Damn you, Al-Fayed," Marta grumbled, running a hand through her grey hair. "You always were a master emotional manipulator."

"It's my best quality," Sarah conceded, though her hands trembled ever so slightly.

Marta walked to a locked cabinet. She pulled out a bottle of pills and a roll of self-adhesive, neon green bandages, the kind she used for horses' legs.

"Broad-spectrum antibiotics," she said, tossing the bottle to Sarah, who caught it mid-air. "And strong painkillers. It's not morphine, but it will make the journey bearable."

She approached the table and began bandaging Elías's leg with abrupt yet efficient movements. The bright green dressing seemed almost comical against the somber situation.

"You have until the rain stops," Marta said without looking at them. "Or until dawn. Whichever comes first. Afterward, if anyone asks, I never saw you. You broke in to steal ketamine and then vanished."

"Thank you," Elías said. He felt light, drifting in a haze of residual pain and exhaustion.

"Don't thank me," she grunted, finishing the bandage. "Just get out of here. And if what they say about that Camiña is true... make sure it's worth the gamble."

Sarah helped Elías sit up. The world spun briefly before settling. His leg felt numb, enveloped in pressure, but the sharp ache had dulled. He could think. He could move.

"Where to now?" Marta asked, opening the back door that opened onto a dirt track, well away from the main road.

Elías adjusted his glasses with fumbling fingers. The image of the inscription in the Noia church shone in his mind with crystalline clarity, superimposed over his mental map of Galicia.

"Where the earth ends," he whispered. "To the end of the world."

Sarah nodded, once again bearing her companion's weight. The rain greeted them like an old acquaintance, cold and indifferent, but now they had a destination. And a bounty on their heads.

## CHAPTER 14: The Hound and the Quarry

The overhead fluorescent light flickered, humming with an electric drone. After four hours on watch, the persistent noise drilled into Inspector Valdés's temple. Santiago's police station reeked of that unmistakable blend of bureaucracy and despair: burnt coffee, damp paper, and the stale sweat of the previous night's detainees.

Outside, the Galician rain showed no mercy, turning the windows into distorted sheets of water that walled off his glass-walled office from the real world. Yet, the true pressure didn't stem from the weather but from the man standing across his desk, so stiff and immaculate that the room's grime seemed to recoil from him.

"The Church demands no miracles, Inspector, only competence," Monsignor Camiña stated. His voice was soft, a baritone honed to reverberate through stone cathedrals, but in the small office, it felt intrusive.

Valdés rubbed his eyelids with thumb and forefinger, feeling the gritty drag of fatigue. He didn't rise. He held his seated posture as a small declaration of territorial sovereignty.

"We've had less than twelve hours, Monsignor. We've scoured the city's exits. Every Civil Guard patrol from Padrón to Finisterre is on alert."

"And yet, Professor Varela and Doctor Al-Fayed remain... absent," the Monsignor articulated the word with clinical distaste, as if speaking of a venereal disease. "And with them, an invaluable piece of the Heritage."

The prelate rested a hand on the desk. Valdés observed the priest's perfectly manicured nails, a stark contrast to the crime scene photos strewn beneath them: the shattered display case, the bloodstains on the museum floor.

"The fifty-thousand-euro reward has generated more noise than leads," the Inspector retorted, gesturing to the landline that had not ceased ringing all morning. "Half the province is calling to report sightings of Elvis or the fugitives buying bread in Betanzos. That obstructs, it doesn't assist."

"Money motivates civic-minded citizens."

"Money motivates greed, Monsignor. And greed makes people foolish."

Camiña slowly withdrew his hand. His eyes, dark and fluid, fixed on the Inspector with an intensity beyond mere concern for a theft. There was urgency there, an electric tension incongruous with the official stance of "cultural asset recovery."

"Inspector," the Monsignor uttered, lowering his tone to a conspiratorial whisper that made the fine hairs on Valdés's nape prickle, "I don't believe you grasp the scale of what's at stake. It's not just an old book. It concerns the stability of... certain institutions. If you cannot locate them before dusk, I will be compelled to escalate this request to the Ministry of the Interior. I am confident that Madrid will better appreciate the gravity of the situation."

The menace hung in the air, thick as cheap cigar smoke. Valdés clenched his jaw until a molar ached.

"Do what you must. I will do my job."

Camiña nodded once, curtly, turned on his heel, and exited the office. Valdés watched the black cassock sway faintly, slicing through the police station's stale air like a scythe.

When the door clicked shut, Valdés released the breath he'd been holding. He rose, walked to the blinds, and peered into the parking lot. He watched the priest step into a black sedan with tinted windows. Too much luxury for a vow of poverty, he thought.

Something was amiss. The official narrative spoke of kidnapping and theft. Elías Varela, an academic with a history of neurosis, had supposedly compelled Sarah Al-Fayed to flee with him. But Valdés had spent twenty years reading people, and Varela's profile—obsessive, timid, a bookworm—didn't square with the boldness of an international fugitive. Camiña's insistence, for his part, exposed poorly concealed desperation.

"To hell with Madrid," he muttered to himself.

Valdés sat back down and unlocked his terminal. He bypassed the patrol reports and opened the DGT traffic server. If Varela and the woman had escaped, they must have used a vehicle. The woman's van, a Citroën C15, was old and noisy. Hard to conceal.

He started tracing the cameras in the O Carballo area, near the veterinary clinic where a patrol had reported "unusual activity" before dawn but found no one.

The clock in the screen's corner read 04:15 AM. Torrential rain. The image was grainy, black and white, with the date blinking in the upper corner.

There it was. The C15 emerging from a secondary road. The license plates were barely discernible, but the dent in the rear bumper matched Al-Fayed's vehicle file.

"Got you," Valdés murmured, jotting down the time and direction. They were headed west. Towards the coast.

He was about to close the window when something at the frame's edge caught his eye. He rewound ten seconds.

A minute after the van vanished from the left margin, another figure appeared. It wasn't a vehicle. It was a man. On foot.

Valdés magnified the image, pixelating the video into a mass of gray and black squares. Still, the silhouette was unmistakable.

The subject was immense. Even distorted by the wide-angle lens, his height appeared anomalous, casting a long shadow across the wet asphalt. He wore a long coat that the wind pressed against his legs, exposing a massive, tectonic build. However, what truly chilled Valdés was his head: under the light of a distant streetlamp, it gleamed pale and utterly hairless.

A knot of ice formed in his gut. It wasn't the subject's size that unsettled him, but his demeanor.

The man didn't run. He moved with a mechanical, predatory stride. He stopped precisely at the intersection where the van had turned. The giant's head swiveled slowly, like a tank turret, scenting the direction his quarry had taken. Then, he resumed his course, disappearing into the darkness with a resolve that needed no haste.

Valdés's mouth went dry. He had seen killers, rapists, people shattered by drugs. But that body language... that was something else entirely. That was military efficiency stripped of humanity.

He re-examined the report Camiña had handed him: "Suspects: Two. Danger Level: Low/Medium."

There was no mention of a third player. No mention of a bald giant tracking the fugitives in the dead of night through the storm.

The Inspector leaned back in his chair, the leather groaning under his weight. The fluorescent's drone seemed more distant now, drowned out by the dry click of pieces falling into place in his mind.

If the Church truly wanted the book back, why send a priest to pressure him while a monstrous hound did the dirty work in the field?

Camiña was lying. Or at the very least, omitting the most brutal part of the truth.

Valdés gazed at Elías Varela's photo in the file. The academic possessed that deer-in-headlights look. And Sarah Al-Fayed, with her defiant expression. They didn't seem like master criminals. They looked like prey.

And the police, Valdés thought with a bitter taste in his mouth, were being used to herd the sheep so the wolf could feast.

He pulled open a desk drawer and retrieved a blank manila folder. He picked up a black marker and penned a name on the tab, but it wasn't Varela's, nor Al-Fayed's.

He wrote: *CAMIÑA / ARCHDIOCESE*.

Next, he opened a new browser window. He steered clear of the police database; it logged every query, and Camiña likely had it monitored through his political connections. Instead, he used a generic search engine, typing with two fingers, slow yet methodical.

"Extremist religious orders Galicia history." "Priscillianist heresy symbolism." "Unsolved disappearances Way of St. James."

The screen returned thousands of results, an ocean of digital static. But Valdés was patient. He possessed the tenacity of an old dog that had bitten into a bone and wouldn't let go until it reached the marrow.

He picked up the phone, but didn't dial the switchboard. He dialed an old colleague from the intelligence unit, a man purged years ago for asking too many questions about clerical finances.

"Manolo," Valdés said when the raspy voice answered on the third ring. "It's me. Don't hang up. I need to know what's stirring in the Cathedral's sewers. And I need to know without the cassocks finding out."

He listened to the reply on the other end, a dry, cynical laugh.

"Yes, I know I'm crazy," Valdés conceded, glancing at the giant's frozen image on his monitor. "But I think there's an animal loose in my jurisdiction, and it's not wearing a badge."

He hung up. The rain still lashed against the glass, but now the sound didn't bother him. Now it had a rhythm. The rhythm of a countdown.

Valdés donned his reading glasses, pulled out a notepad, and began to write. He was no longer searching for book thieves. Now he sought to comprehend who the hunter was, to foresee where the quarry would fall.

If Elías and Sarah were heading for the coast, for Finisterre, they were moving toward a geographical trap. The end of the world offered no escape.

"Run," he whispered to the screen, addressing the pixelated fugitives. "Run, because what trails you will not be stopped by handcuffs."

## Chapter 15: Danza de la Muerte en Muros

CHAPTER 15 - Dance of Death in Muros

The Muros air reeked of aged salt and gutted fish, a heavy, clingy blend that caught in the throat. The evening settled over the Galician estuary, staining the waters lead-grey and transforming the town's famed stone arcades into dark mouths that gulped down the light.

Elías Varela leaned against the damp granite of the fountain in Fish Market Square. His right leg, still healing from their last flight, was a pulsing anchor, a detached mass of flesh that screamed with each shift of his weight. Yet, the physical agony receded, overshadowed by the intellectual compulsion that consumed him.

"Look at this, Sarah," he whispered, his voice hoarse with exhaustion. "It's not decorative."

He adjusted his glasses, which slipped down the bridge of his sweaty nose. His fingers, stained with ink and dirt, traced the etched scallop shell at the spigot's base. Water welled from the stone, worn smooth by centuries of erosion, but Elías saw no water. He saw patterns.

"The stonemasons of this town didn't follow the official Codex Calixtinus," he went on, speaking more to himself than to her, sinking into that private world of abstraction that was his sole sanctuary. "This shell has nine ridges, not the usual number. They align with the constellation Eridanus. The River of Stars."

Sarah Al-Fayed wasn't watching the fountain. Her gaze swept the square's perimeter, scanning tourists who ambled by, ice creams in hand, cameras slung around their necks. The jarring contrast between holiday frivolity and the threat dogging their heels churned her stomach.

"Elías, we have to move," she pressed, her tone sharp as a north wind. "We're too exposed."

"One moment. I just need to record the axis's alignment..."

Sarah turned her head toward the shop windows of Rúa Real. The glass of a ceramics shop mirrored the street behind her: families strolling, a dog barking at a seagull, and, silhouetted against the port's milky light, a figure that didn't belong.

It was a massive silhouette, unmoving within the current of people. A long coat, far too heavy for the season, hung from him like a dark cassock. His shaved head gleamed pale, devoid of brows, an unexpressive marble mask.

Sarah's world reeled. There was no dramatic music, only the dull sound of her own breath catching in her throat.

"He's here," she breathed, not a shout, but an exhalation of sheer terror.

Elías looked up, bewildered, just as Sarah seized his good arm with a grip that promised bruises.

"Run!"

The yank nearly unbalanced him. Elías stumbled, and the pain in his leg detonated like a white supernova behind his eyelids. An involuntary groan escaped his lips, but adrenaline, that primal chemical, surged through his system, forcing his muscles to obey.

They plunged beneath the arcades. The maritime architecture, designed to shelter from the rain, now became a claustrophobic tunnel.

Silas didn't run. He didn't need to. He moved with the fluidity of a dark tide, consuming the distance with long, silent strides that belied his bulk.

"That way!" Sarah cried, shoving aside a group of teenagers who blocked their path.

They veered into a side alley, hoping to vanish into the old town's maze. The uneven flagstones were a death trap for Elías's limp. Each jarring strike of his heel against the stone sent an electric shock through his hip. He gasped, the metallic taste of blood filling his mouth where he'd bitten his tongue.

"I can't...!" the paleographer stammered, his lungs feeling like crumpled paper bags.

"Stop now, and you die!" Sarah snapped, dragging him along.

They rounded a corner and collided with a terrace packed with tables. Tourists laughed, clinking glasses of white wine, oblivious to the hunt. Sarah upended a chair as she passed, hoping to create a barrier, ignoring the diners' outraged protests.

She glanced back. The bald giant had just turned the corner.

A young man, a backpacker with a guitar slung over his shoulder, accidentally stepped into the Pilgrim's path, reaching for the fallen chair.

Silas didn't stop. He didn't even slow. With an efficient, savage motion, he extended his arm. His hand, wide as a shovel, struck the young man's chest.

The sound was dry, sickening, like a thick branch snapping under a boot.

The boy hurtled backward, his body an inert projectile that slammed into a bakery window. Glass shivered into a lethal diamond rain, and the body crumpled among the pastries, still, his neck bent at an unnatural angle.

Time on the terrace fractured. Absolute silence reigned for one beat, before screams tore through the afternoon.

Chaos erupted. People stampeded, overturning tables, trampling each other in blind panic. It was perfect cover.

"To the port!" Sarah commanded, seizing the confusion. The human tide swirled, forming a living shield between them and the killer.

Elías, waxen-pale, had witnessed the summary execution. The raw truth of death, shorn of ceremony or ritual, struck him harder than any historical revelation. That man was no human; he was a biblical force of nature, a bipedal plague.

They burst from the shelter of the cobbled streets onto the port's esplanade. The sea wind whipped their faces. Small fishing boats bobbed gently, their brightly painted hulls groaning against the tire fenders lining the dock.

Sarah scanned her options. A yacht was locked. A larger fishing vessel would take too long to prepare.

There.

A small motorboat, laden with orange nets, had its outboard motor tilted up, but signs of recent activity were clear. An old fisherman stood on the dock, his back to the boat, stacking plastic crates.

"I'm sorry," Sarah murmured.

They scrambled for the rusty metal ladder leading down to the water. Elías slipped on the last rung, green with slime, and tumbled hard into the boat. His knee slammed against the fiberglass, tearing a cry from him that vanished into the gulls' shrieks.

Sarah leaped in after him. The fisherman spun around, eyes wide beneath his wool cap.

"Hey! What are you doing?" the man shouted in Galician, dropping a crate.

Sarah ignored him. She lunged for the control console. No keys.

"Damn it!" She slammed her fist onto the plastic.

"He's coming!" Elías yelled from the boat's floor, pointing skyward.

At the edge of the dock, stark against the grey sky, Silas appeared. His coat billowed in the wind. Something metallic glinted in his right hand—not a gun, but a curved blade, a skinning knife.

Sarah's gaze darted wildly. She spotted the kill switch cord dangling from the wrist of the fisherman, who was now rushing toward them, yelling. Without the safety clip, the engine wouldn't start.

But she saw something else: a screwdriver abandoned on the stern bench.

With skill born of desperation, Sarah jammed the screwdriver into the ignition slot and twisted with all her might, bypassing the circuit. The engine coughed, sputtered, and then roared to life with a plume of blue smoke.

Silas leaped.

It was an impossible leap for a man his size, a controlled three-meter drop, meant to land atop them and crush them.

Sarah shoved the throttle to its limit. The propeller bit into the water, cavitating for a moment before finding purchase. The boat lurched violently forward, flinging Elías against the nets.

The assassin splashed into the water, mere inches from the stern, where the engine's churning, white foam momentarily swallowed him.

The vessel shot away from the dock, bouncing over the estuary's short waves. Sarah kept the throttle wide open until they were two hundred meters out, the engine screaming in protest.

Elías struggled to his feet, gripping the gunwale. He looked back, toward the shrinking port of Muros in the distance.

A sodden figure rose from the water, climbing the metal ladder. Silas stood on the dock, streaming saltwater, still as a Gothic gargoyle transplanted into modernity. He showed no sign of frustration. He simply stood, watching, marking their position, a beacon of darkness promising that the ocean was not vast enough to hide them.

Sarah set their course for the mouth of the estuary, toward the open sea and the perilous swells of the Costa da Morte. Her hands trembled on the wheel, not from cold, but from the seismic aftershock of the violence she had witnessed.

"Are you alright?" she asked, without looking at him.

Elías patted his jacket pocket, verifying the notebook was still there. Then he looked at his leg; blood stained his corduroy trousers.

"I'm surviving," he replied, the word tasting of ash. "But he... he won't stop, Sarah. He's not a man. He's a consequence."

The motorboat cleaved the grey water, carrying with it two fugitives and a new terror, deeper and colder than the Atlantic waters now spreading before them.

## Chapter 16: A la Deriva

CHAPTER 16 - Adrift

The silence that followed the outboard engine's final gasp was more chilling than the chase's roar. No final cough, no black smoke; just a sheer mechanical capitulation, a metallic clack, and then the water's relentless slosh against the fiberglass.

Sarah let the starter cord snap back with a surge of suppressed anger. Her knuckles, bone-white with cold and strain, rapped the Yamaha's cowling. The flat thud reverberated across the vast estuary like a misfire.

"It's flooded," she declared. Her voice was raw, scoured by brine and earlier screams. "Or we've burnt out the transmission. Either way, we're just flotsam now."

Elias Varela didn't answer right away. He was curled up in the stern, trying to stretch his injured leg without grazing the rusted fishing tackle strewn across the boat's floor. The pain in his thigh was no longer a white-hot needle, but a sickening, dull pulse, a drumbeat that kept pace with the rocking of the waves. He adjusted his glasses, uselessly blurred by the night's sea fog, and gazed back at the receding coast. Muros' lights were now a smudged orange glow, remote and heedless of their predicament.

The sea had turned into an obsidian mirror, devouring the horizon line until it was impossible to discern where ocean bled into sky. They drifted within a sphere of unyielding gloom.

"The outgoing current," Elias mumbled, watching the boat yaw sluggishly on its axis. "The ebb tide pulls us northwest."

"Out to open sea," Sarah corrected, slumping onto the mid-thwart. She rubbed her arms, trying to coax warmth from the damp fabric of her tactical gear. "If we can't row or get seen, we'll greet the dawn in the mid-Atlantic. Or we won't greet the dawn at all."

Elias clasped the Codex to his chest. The object, wrapped in layers of plastic and cloth, physically weighed no more than a brick, yet its presence exerted its own oppressive gravity. It was no inert burden; it was a black hole that had siphoned all normalcy from his existence, distorting reality until it had stranded him here, shivering in a stolen nutshell, with a fanatic assassin on his heels. He felt the ancient parchment sapping his body heat, feasting on his warmth to sustain its own infernal existence.

"We can't row against this," he said, watching the foam churn around the hull. "The estuary's a funnel. We have to let it carry us and hope the current sweeps us toward the north shore before we clear the headlands' shelter."

Sarah nodded, resigned. The adrenaline that had kept her functional throughout the escape was draining away, laying bare a fatigue ancient as bedrock. She looked at her hands, smeared with grease and dried blood.

"I've never liked silence," she murmured, her gaze lost in the inky water. "At digs, even at night, there's always noise. Generators, wind flapping against the canvas, people snoring. This... this is an emptiness."

Elias watched her. For the first time, the pragmatic historian's shell cracked. He didn't see the woman who leapt across rooftops, but someone profoundly lonely.

"Silence is necessary for reading," he offered, awkwardly.

"Not when you're alone," she retorted, and the word "alone" hung between them. "My parents were diplomats. We lived in three different countries every two years. I learned not to put down roots, to be efficient, to move fast. If you stay still, you realize you belong nowhere." She looked up, her dark eyes mirroring the faint starlight. "Being adrift, Elias... it's my recurring nightmare. No engine, no course. Just waiting."

Elias shifted, and a jolt in his leg made him hiss.

"I've spent my life still," he said, trying to distract her, and perhaps himself from the cold that bit to the bone. "In libraries, in archives, in windowless offices. Believing that if I didn't move, I couldn't break anything."

Sarah let out a short, humorless laugh.

"And yet, you broke Camiña."

The prelate's name hung in the salty air. Elias felt the familiar tightening in his gut, a blend of scholarly shame and suicidal rectitude.

"It wasn't intentional." Elias wiped his glasses with the dry edge of his scarf. "Camiña based his ascent to the bishopric on the discovery of a supposedly foundational document in the Cathedral archives. A 12th-century papal bull granting unprecedented privileges to the diocese. It was to be his legacy, his political triumph. He asked me to authenticate it. He expected a formality, a signature."

"And it was fake?" Sarah asked.

"Worse. It was authentic, but he'd misinterpreted it." Elias looked at his own hands, the ink stain on his middle finger faintly visible in the gloom. "The Latin was... intricate. Camiña read 'perpetual concession.' The actual text, under rigorous paleographic scrutiny, stated 'temporary concession subject to purity of faith.' More to the point, and more ironically, the document included an excommunication clause for anyone who sought personal enrichment through those privileges."

The boat rocked gently. The water slapped the hull with a hypnotic rhythm.

"You published it," she surmised.

"I corrected it. In a footnote of an article I thought no one would read. But Camiña's rivals did read. They used my correction to humiliate him, to block his funding in Rome. I ruined his reputation with a Latin preposition." Elias sighed, his breath plumed in an ephemeral cloud. "He believes it was malice. He thinks I'm a saboteur. But I just... I couldn't let the lie stand. History is all we have. If we corrupt it, what's left?"

"The living remain," Sarah said softly. "And sometimes, the living bleed because of footnotes."

Elias didn't answer. He knew she was right. His quest for absolute truth had exacted a human cost. Now, that very quest had brought them to the brink of hypothermia.

To avoid Sarah's gaze, he lifted his head to the sky. Storm clouds had ripped apart, unveiling a stellar tapestry so brilliant it hurt his eyes. Far from the cities' light pollution, the Galician sky was an overwhelming map.

"Look," he whispered, pointing south, below Orion's belt. "There."

Sarah followed his gaze.

"What am I seeing?"

"Eridanus. The River constellation." Elias's voice took on the low, almost reverent cadence he used in his lectures. "In mythology, it's the river into which Phaeton tumbled when he lost control of the sun's chariot. It's the path to the underworld."

He traced an imaginary line in the air with a trembling hand.

"It's not a guide constellation for sailors, not like the Big Dipper. It's a warning route. It winds across the sky, hard to trace, filled with faint stars. The ancients claimed its waters were treacherous."

"Very fitting," Sarah murmured, hugging her knees. "We're sailing on its reflection."

"No," Elias corrected, and for a moment, fear drained from his face, superseded by the scholar's piercing clarity. "The Codex speaks of 'following the river of dark stars.' I always thought it was a spiritual metaphor. But if you overlay Eridanus on the map of the estuary..." He paused, mapping the constellations in his mind. "The mouth of the stellar river aligns with the ocean exit. But its source... its source points to Mount Pindo. The Celtic Olympus."

Sarah sat up, the boat listed precariously with her abrupt movement.

"Are you saying the current is taking us exactly where we need to go?"

"I'm saying that those who charted this route knew the tides and the sky better than we do. We're not fleeing haphazardly, Sarah. We are on a pilgrimage. Even in our drift."

A new silence settled between them, this time less oppressive. It was the silence of two pieces that had just clicked into place. Sarah looked at Elias, at that stooped man, ill-suited for action, who, despite everything, discerned maps in chaos. And Elias looked at Sarah, the woman who dreaded stillness, now forced to trust in quietude.

"Elias!" she exclaimed abruptly, pointing to starboard.

In the distance, in the profound darkness of the north coast, which loomed like a stony maw, a light flickered. It wasn't a lighthouse. It was something softer, rhythmic. A bonfire, or perhaps a signal.

"Carnota," Elias identified, squinting. "Galicia's longest beach."

The current had indeed propelled them across the estuary's mouth. They were far, miles away, but the water's movement drew them relentlessly toward that untamed shore.

"We have to row," Sarah said, and this time, her voice held not despair, but purpose. She reached under the bench and pulled out a splintered wooden oar. She handed the other to Elias. "Just to correct our bearing. The tide will do the rest."

Elias took the oar. The wood was cold and rough. His leg protested as he braced it for leverage, but he ignored the pain. He looked at the distant light, then at the river of stars above his head, and finally at the Codex resting at his feet.

He plunged the blade into the black water, shattering the sky's reflection. They rowed. Not toward safety, but toward the next enigma.

## Chapter 17: El Hórreo Infinito

CAPÍTULO: 17 - The Infinite Hórreo

Dawn brought no light, only the blackness softening to a pearly grey, damp and clammy. A briny mist gripped the Carnota coastline, rendering the landscape an unfinished watercolor.

Elías Varela limped onward, dragging his injured leg. The raw agony had subsided, giving way to a dense, deadening numbness, as if molten lead had replaced bone and muscle within the limb. Each step, first across the firm sand, then the rough asphalt of the slumbering village, became a tense negotiation between his failing joint and his sheer will.

“Faster,” Sarah whispered, her voice tight, yet devoid of reproach.

Her shoulder was a steadfast anchor beneath his right arm. Her body heat seeped through the layers of their sodden clothes, a thermal friction that kept Elías tethered to consciousness. The ocean's chill had permeated to his very bones, transmuting the uncontrollable shiver from an hour past into a cadaverous stiffness.

“There,” Elías gasped, his finger, a bluish claw, jabbing.

Before them stood the most imposing civil structure the paleographer had ever witnessed, save perhaps within the pages of a Roman architectural treatise. The Hórreo of Carnota. It bore no resemblance to a mere granary; in the milky gloom of pre-dawn, it appeared a suspended temple, a granite centipede nearly thirty-five meters long, propped on twenty-two pairs of stone feet.

Sarah pulled him into the monument's looming shadow. The village slept on, its quiet broken only by a dog's distant bark and the steady pulse of the Atlantic at their backs. They slipped beneath the hórreo's belly, among the pillars—the *stipes*—and the circular slabs—the *tornarratas*—meant to keep rodents from the sacred harvest.

Elías slumped against one of the columns. The stone felt frigid, yet offered a staunch solidity the sea had withheld. He pulled off his glasses; salt crystals coated the lenses, splintering his vision into a thousand grimy prisms. He wiped them with the inside of his tweed jacket, itself scarcely less damp than its exterior, succeeding only in smearing the grime.

“We need to move before people stir,” Sarah muttered, her gaze sweeping the perimeter. Her dark eyes never settled, cataloging escape routes, perils, shelter. “We can't head for the hotel. We look like survivors of a wreck.”

“No... wait.” Elías slipped his glasses back on. The world sharpened into stark relief.

From his low vantage point, the hórreo’s aspect shifted dramatically. No longer a simple corn store, it was a machine.

He studied the ventilation slits carved into the stone of the upper chamber. At a glance, they appeared functional, crafted for the wind to dry the grain. But Elías's mind, honed to discern patterns in the disarray of Visigothic calligraphy, caught a subtle anomaly in their regularity.

The arrangement lacked true symmetry.

“Elías?” Sarah nudged his shoulder.

“Stone has a tongue, Sarah. One only needs to grasp its grammar.” His voice came out ragged, but mental exhaustion had vanished, overridden by the fervor of discovery. “Observe the fissures. The air vents.”

She tracked his gaze toward the granite structure's apex.

“They're air vents. Baroque style, eighteenth century.”

“Eighteenth century, indeed. But erected atop older foundations. Observe the slant of the third section.”

Elías hauled himself upright, heedless of his knee's mechanical complaint. He shuffled along the columned walkway, counting the pairs of feet. One, two, three… He halted at the seventh pair.

“Here,” he murmured, his hand tracing the pillar's base. A stonemason's mark, nearly erased by three centuries of Galician rain. A double spiral.

“What does it mean?” she asked, drawing nearer.

“It's not ornamentation. It's an alignment.” Elías swung his head, seeking the eastern horizon where the day's burgeoning light began to pierce the gloom. “The hórreo builders honored function, yet the master masons here carried ancient traditions, which the Church never quite managed to extirpate.”

He crouched, compelling Sarah to do likewise, to peer through two distinct ventilation slits that lined up precisely from that angle. They created a stone sighting device.

“Look through them. What do you see?”

Sarah narrowed her eyes, bringing her sight into line with the masonry gaps. Through the stone tunnel, the fog parted just enough to disclose a conical silhouette, dark and foreboding, towering over the surrounding landscape like a slumbering titan.

“A mountain,” she said. “A rocky peak.”

“Mount Pindo,” Elías stated, a reverence in his tone he seldom reserved for anything other than a book. “The Celtic Olympus. *Mons Sacer*.”

He pushed off from the column, his mind assembling the pieces with sudden clarity.

“The Codex mentioned ‘dark stars’ and bleeding stone. We always presumed the stellar path required a gaze upward, toward the night sky. But this hórreo doesn't merely hold grain; it cradles a direction. It's a static compass.”

“Are you telling me an eighteenth-century granary points to a sacred pagan mountain?”

“I'm telling you that folk architecture is the last refuge of forbidden knowledge. When the Inquisition set fire to books, people inscribed their secrets on their house walls, their *cruceiros*, their hórreos.” Elías pointed toward the distant peak. “The alignment is solar. It marks the solstice, but also indicates the path into the granite massif's heart. That's our destination. Deep into Pindo's bowels.”

Sarah nodded slowly. The technical exposition had quelled her immediate apprehension; a clear geographical objective was something she could handle. Yet a visible shiver traced her frame, and it stemmed not from the mysticism of the moment.

“Alright. To Olympus we go,” she said, chafing her arms with force. “But if we don't get dry within the next twenty minutes, we'll succumb to hypothermia long before we reach that mountain's foot. My fingers are starting to lose all sensation.”

Elías surveyed his own clothes. The sodden tweed reeked of damp dog and decaying seaweed. It felt impossibly heavy.

“We need... supplies,” he admitted.

Sarah was already in motion. She had ceased scrutinizing ancient stones, her focus now fixed on the urgent present. Some fifty meters from the hórreo, beyond a low dry-stone wall enclosing a garden patch, stood a slate-roofed stone cottage. To its side, sheltered by an overhang, a clothesline bore several garments that had endured the night's chill, yet were shielded from direct rain.

“Stay here,” she commanded. Her stance shifted; her center of gravity dropped, and she moved with the liquid grace of a city predator.

Elías watched her vanish behind the wall. He felt briefly useless, a mind trapped in a compromised vessel, awaiting its physical return. He seized the chance to draw the Codex from his inner pocket, still swathed in the three layers of archival plastic he always carried. The parchment was dry. He exhaled, his breath a pale cloud in the frigid air.

Minutes later, Sarah returned. She clutched a bundle of clothes beneath her arm, an inscrutable look on her face.

“It's not haute couture,” she said, tossing him a thick, navy wool sweater and a pair of waxed canvas work trousers. “They belonged to a stout individual. They'll swallow you, but they're dry.”

“Theft?” Elías asked, though he was already fumbling with the buttons of his drenched jacket.

“An indefinite loan for survival. I left fifty euros beneath a flowerpot. It was all the dry cash I possessed.”

They changed right there, hidden behind the hórreo's cyclopean pillars. The touch of dry wool against his skin brought an almost painful intensity, a relief so profound Elías felt his knees buckle. The trousers hung loose, forcing him to cinch the belt to its final notch, but the waxed canvas offered the promise of wind protection.

Sarah donned a grey sweatshirt and an olive work jacket, which lent her an improvised military bearing. She gathered her damp hair into a tight plait, wringing out the saltwater before securing it.

“We look like locals heading to work,” she assessed, glancing down at her boots. “Or at least, not like fugitives from a museum.”

Elías tucked his now-dry glasses into the pocket of his new trousers. He peered once more through the hórreo's slits toward Mount Pindo. The mountain darkened as the light grew behind it, a shadow behemoth awaiting them.

“The climb will be arduous,” he cautioned, testing his weight on his compromised leg. “The dry clothes and renewed warmth offered a fleeting illusion of safety, but biomechanics never lied. Pindo is a stone labyrinth. They say the rocks there assume human shapes.”

“I'm more concerned about the humans with hearts of stone,” Sarah retorted, adjusting her blade on the newly acquired belt. “Let's go. Before the owner of these clothes decides to step out for a smoke.”

They emerged from the Infinite Hórreo's shelter, leaving the coastline and civilization's faint marks behind, heading inland, where geography and myth wove together into a granite snare.

## Chapter 18: El Olimpo Celta

The granite of Mount Pindo showed no mercy for human frailty. Beneath the veil of rain blurring the Galician horizon, rock formations loomed like petrified titans caught in an agonized contortion, watching impassively the two intruders' progress.

Elías Varela felt his right leg had ceased to be a part of him, transforming into a leaden dead weight, alien to his will. Each upward step along the goat track was a negotiation with gravity lost before it began. His muscle tissue, inflamed from the escape from Carnota, burned with a localized fever, a stark contrast to the damp cold that soaked through his stolen overalls. It wasn't a sharp pain, but a grinding resistance, as though his knee's gears had rusted beyond repair.

"Don't stop," Sarah ordered, her voice barely audible above the wind's howl tearing across the slope. "If the muscle chills, you'll never get it moving again."

She walked three meters ahead, moving with an enviable economy of motion. Her hiking boots found purchase on the slick lichen where Elías's dress shoes, now sodden and warped, skidded uselessly. Sarah paused beside a stone block that resembled a decapitated warrior and extended her hand downward.

Elías accepted the grip. Her skin was rough, cold, yet the power of her pull was tectonic. For an instant, the paleographer hung suspended, relying entirely on her balance — an inversion of roles that struck his academic pride harder than any exhaustion. In the library, he was the authority; here, in this raw domain of rough stone and raw weather, he was a mere logistical burden.

"The geological structure is... hostile," he gasped, fumbling for a handhold on the wet rock to lighten the strain on Sarah's grip.

"It's a natural defense," she corrected, releasing him only when certain of his stability. "That's why they chose it. No one climbs up here by accident."

They continued the ascent. The mist closed in and parted in spectral tatters, briefly revealing the valley below, a dizzying plunge to the Atlantic. The Codex, tucked beneath Elías's layers of synthetic clothing, seemed to gain weight with every upward step, as if the ink itself reacted to its origin's proximity.

They reached the upper plateau, a jumble of granite boulders where reality itself seemed to warp. There, atop the summit, lay the *Pedra da Moa*. It wasn't a human construction, but a vast, flat slab, sculpted by millennia of erosion and dotted with natural depressions brimming with rainwater.

Elías limped closer, wiping rain from his spectacles with a clumsy, frustrated swipe that only smeared the lenses further. He removed them, narrowing his gray eyes at the sheer scale of the place.

"Do you see it?" he whispered, forgetting for a moment the burning in his thigh. "It's not a church. It never was."

Sarah traced the edge of one of the *cazoletas*, the hollows in the rock, with her fingers.

"Sacrificial altars," she pronounced with professional detachment. "Celtic. Fourth century BC, perhaps earlier."

"And yet, the Codex brought us here." Elías slumped onto a dry, leeward rock, drawing out the manuscript with trembling hands. "For centuries, the Church tried to Christianize this mountain. They built hermitages, forbade the rites... but Priscillian wasn't trying to destroy this."

He opened the book to the page they had deciphered in the hórreo. The star chart didn't align with Santiago Cathedral, but with the very terrain before their eyes.

"Priscillian was executed for heresy and witchcraft," Elías continued, his mind racing, forging connections that numbed his physical discomfort. "Official history says his sect was overly ascetic. But this..." He gestured towards the pagan altar. "This suggests something more radical. He wasn't just a dissident bishop. He was weaving druidism into the faith. He wasn't seeking a tomb for his body."

Sarah spun around sharply, the wind whipping her dark braid across her face.

"What do you mean?"

"That the 'True Tomb' we seek, the one the *Stelliferi* guard with murder... it doesn't contain bones." Elías gazed at the flat stone, the play of shadows under the diffused midday light. "It's a reliquary. A container."

Sarah drew her multi-tool knife, not as a weapon, but as a probing instrument. She moved towards the exact point where the geometry of the *Pedra da Moa* converged with the main fissure of the summit, the place that, according to the medieval text, marked the "heart of the star."

"Here," she said. Her voice lost its usual steadiness.

Elías forced himself to his feet, dragging his leg like a lifeless log. He knelt beside her.

At the base of the great slab, concealed by a moss-covered granite outcropping, was a hollow. It was no natural erosion. The edges showed chisel marks, ancient yet unmistakable, softened by centuries of lichen growth. It was a rectangular cavity, sized perfectly to hold a box, a chest, or... a book.

The hollow lay empty.

But it was no ancient void. At the bottom of the small recess, the accumulated rock dust and soil bore a cleaner, darker rectangular imprint than the surrounding area. Someone had been there. And not centuries ago.

"The patina is disturbed," Sarah noted, illuminating the interior with her phone's flashlight, cupping her hand around the beam. "There are fresh gouges on the stone. Someone took it."

Elías felt a dizziness that had nothing to do with the height. The euphoria of intellectual breakthrough imploded, leaving a nauseating hollowness in his gut. All the pain, the escape, the fear in the hórreo... only to arrive at a plundered nest.

He reached into the hollow, brushing against the cold stone. His fingers brushed against something small tucked into a corner, something the thief had either missed or disdained.

He brought it to light. It was a metal shard, barely a sliver of rusted iron, and a fragment of red wax.

"A seal," Elías murmured, recognizing the texture. "Someone broke a wax seal here."

"The Pilgrim?" Sarah asked, scanning the rocky perimeter with a fresh surge of paranoia, her hand drifting back to her knife hilt.

"No. He kills to guard the secret, to ensure no one ever reached this place. If he had it, the game would be over." Elías squeezed the wax fragment in his fist until it crumbled. "Whoever took this did so to use it, not to hide it away."

He looked around, at the desolate Galician landscape. The sacred mountain, the Celtic Olympus, now felt like a stage abandoned after the final curtain. They had arrived late. History had outpaced them.

"What was it?" Sarah asked, staring at the empty hollow. "What sacred object warrants such bloodshed, Elías?"

Elías looked at the Codex, whose pages now seemed to mock him.

"The *Lapis Exillis*," he whispered, a theory crystalizing in his mind with the chilling certainty of the unavoidable. "The stone that fell from the sky. The heretics' grail."

The rain intensified, erasing the world below them. They were alone on the summit, disoriented, with a lead that vanished into thin air and an unseen foe who now held the artifact capable of rewriting Christendom.

"We need to get down," Sarah said, shattering the spell of defeat. Her pragmatism returned. "We're sitting targets up here. And we need to find out who else knew this site."

Elías nodded, though the prospect of the descent, with gravity tugging at his mangled knee, felt like a medieval torment. They had climbed seeking an answer, only to descend with a far more perilous question. The map was useless now. They had to go back to the start.

## Chapter 19: La Trampa de Ézaro

CAPÍTULO: 19 - The Ézaro Trap

The descent from Mount Pindo wasn't a hike; it was a controlled plunge through a vertical hell. Gravity clawed at them with cruel fingers, dragging them toward the mouth of the Xallas River, where the famous Ézaro waterfall hurled itself into the sea with the might of a biblical cataclysm.

Elías Varela's right knee felt less like a human joint and more like a ruined mechanism, gritty with sand and ground glass. Each downward step sent an electric jolt that blurred his vision, vying with the rain lashing his fogged spectacles. This wasn't merely water; it was liquid ice needles flung by a furious sky that offered no quarter. Beneath the stolen work coveralls, the Priscillian Codex pressed against his ribs, a tumor of parchment and secrets that seemed to gain mass with every meter they descended. It didn't weigh like a book; it weighed like a damnation.

"Move, Varela!" Sarah roared, her voice barely cutting through the water's thunder.

She led the way, an efficient shadow moving with feline precision across the slick granite. Her black braid, drenched, whipped like a dark scourge against the back of her jacket.

They reached ground level, where wooden walkways snaked toward the hydroelectric plant and the bridge spanning the river. The cascade's roar, lit artificially by orange floodlights battling the storm, fashioned a disorienting cacophony. Pulverized water hung in the air, a thick mist that transformed the world into a spectral stage of chiaroscuro.

Sarah stopped short at the walkway's end, raising a clenched fist. Elías collided with her, suppressing a groan as his leg protested the sudden halt.

"What...?" he began to ask, frantically wiping a lens of his spectacles with a wet thumb.

"Structurally unsound," she whispered, gesturing toward the concrete bridge crossing the river, the sole vehicular exit to the regional road.

Elías narrowed his eyes. Through the curtain of rain, he discerned two rectangular shapes barring the way. Black SUVs, parked in a wedge to form a barricade. No lights shone. They appeared as obsidian monoliths awaiting sacrifice. Beside them, three figures stood motionless, unperturbed by the deluge.

"Not tourists," Elías mumbled, a knot of panic tightening in his throat, entirely unrelated to the cold.

"The Order brought cavalry," Sarah confirmed, coolly appraising their surroundings. "They knew Pindo would spew us out here. It's a natural funnel."

"Silas?"

"No giant among them. These are containment specialists." Sarah pulled back, nudging Elías into the shadow of a retaining wall. "We're boxed in. River behind us, granite at our flanks, and a firing squad ahead."

Before Elías could grasp the grimness of their plight, a new sound shattered the water's drone. The agonizing screech of tires on wet asphalt.

A gray sedan skidded into the scenic overlook's access curve, braking with such force that its chassis pitched precariously forward. Headlights swept the scene, briefly illuminating the dark figures on the bridge and disclosing their weaponry: compact submachine guns gleaming under the halogen light.

The sedan's driver-side door burst open. Inspector Valdés sprang out like a bull gored by a banderilla, pistol drawn, his face contorted by the vexation of an endless pursuit.

"Stop! National Police!" Valdés bellowed, his voice frayed with tension. He wasn't looking at the bridge; his eyes scoured the darkness of the walkways for Elías and Sarah. For him, only the fugitives existed.

It was a colossal miscalculation.

The Order's mercenaries didn't hesitate. There were no warnings, no parley. Their weapons didn't sound like movie gunshots; these were dry, mechanical clicks, like breaking branches, muted by the waterfall's roar.

Valdés's car windshield exploded into a web of diamonds. The inspector, realizing too late he'd stumbled into a war he didn't grasp, dropped to the ground, rolling toward the engine block's shelter.

"Down!" Sarah tackled Elías, flattening him against the walkway's damp wood.

Bullets began to peck at the stone and wood around them. Splinters flew like shrapnel. The air thickened with a biting scent, a blend of storm ozone and burnt cordite.

"They're shooting at the police!" Elías cried, face pressed to the wet planks, unable to fathom his pursuers' audacity.

"They're clearing the field," Sarah corrected, raising her head mere millimeters to observe. "Valdés is pinned. They've got suppressing fire on him."

The inspector fired blindly from behind his front wheel, yellow flashes briefly lighting the rain. The mercenaries advanced methodically, tightening the angle.

Sarah eyed Valdés's car. The engine still ran; the exhaust pipe spat white smoke. The driver's door hung wide open, an obscene invitation amid the chaos.

"Elías," she said, seizing his sodden coveralls by the lapels. Her black eyes gleamed with terrifying resolve. "Listen closely. We're stealing that car."

"Are you insane? They'll shoot at us too."

"They're focused on the armed man. It's our only opening." Sarah indicated the distance: twenty meters of exposed asphalt. "On my signal, run. Don't look back. Don't stop even if your leg feels like it's snapping in two."

"I can't run..."

"Run or die here, archivist!" she snapped, shaking him.

A volley of shots blew out Valdés's car's rearview mirror. The inspector yelled something unintelligible, reloading his weapon with trembling hands. The mercenaries pressed forward two more paces.

"Now!"

Sarah launched herself like a sprinter off the blocks. Elías, driven by sheer terror, forced his body to obey. He surged to his feet, ignoring the howl of protest from his nerve endings, and broke into a run.

The world narrowed to a tunnel vision. Rain hammered his face. His breath came in ragged gasps. He saw the sedan's open door as a gateway to another dimension.

*Ten meters.*
A mercenary turned his head. The movement was fluid, robotic. His weapon's muzzle arced toward them.

*Five meters.*
Valdés saw them.
"Varela! Halt!" the inspector bellowed, raising his weapon toward them, torn between shooting his attackers or his quarry.

A mercenary's bullet struck the asphalt inches from Elías's left foot, blasting up a geyser of foul water and gravel. He stumbled, his bad leg giving way under his weight like a column of wet plaster.

Sarah, already at the car, spun on her heel. She didn't seek cover. She plunged back, seized Elías by the back of his coveralls, and yanked him with animal strength, dragging him the final meters.

"Get in!" she howled, shoving him over the driver's seat and onto the passenger side.

Elías collapsed bonelessly onto the gearshift, banging his shoulder against the glove compartment. Pain momentarily blinded him. Sarah slid behind the wheel, slamming the door shut just as two metallic thumps echoed against the door's sheet metal.

Valdés, two meters away, hammered the window with his pistol butt, his eyes bulging with disbelief and rage.
"Get out of the car! Damn it, get out now—!"

A fresh burst of fire from the mercenaries forced the inspector back down.

Sarah stomped the clutch and jammed the car into first gear with a growl. The car protested, its wheels skidding on the waterlogged pavement for purchase, then, with a jolt that nearly wrenched Elías's neck, the vehicle shot forward.

"Duck!" Sarah commanded.

The car fishtailed, clearing one of the blocking SUVs by scant inches. Sarah didn't brake; she used the sedan's bumper to strike the side of the enemy vehicle, a dull, brutal impact that forced an opening just wide enough to squeeze through. Metal against metal, sparks flying in the rain.

Elías glanced through the rear window. He saw Valdés standing alone in the middle of the road, in the rain, firing impotently at the taillights of his own car as the mercenaries shifted targets, now aiming at the fleeing vehicle.

The rear window glass imploded, showering the back seat with safety fragments.

Sarah wrenched the wheel, taking the scenic overlook's exit curve at a suicidal speed. The car settled, its engine roaring as they devoured asphalt, speeding away from the cascade's din and the death awaiting on the bridge.

Elías slowly straightened, picking a shard of glass from his pant crease. His heart hammered against the Codex hidden in his chest, a frantic beat that seemed intent on escaping its rib cage.

"Are you hurt?" Sarah asked, her gaze fixed on the dark road, knuckles white on the steering wheel.

Elías checked himself. Pain in his leg, pain in his ribs, pain in his soul. But no fresh blood.

"I'm... whole," he gasped, wiping his spectacles with the inspector's dry sleeve, which lay on the passenger seat. "You have... you have glass in your hair."

Sarah let out a short, hysterical, humorless laugh. She checked the rearview mirror one last time. No one pursued them yet, but it was a matter of moments.

"Welcome to fieldwork, Elías," she said, flooring the accelerator. "Now, tell me you know where we're headed, because we just stole a disguised patrol car and have half the world on our tail."

Elías glanced at the dashboard. The police radio spat static and incomprehensible codes. They were alive. For now.

"South," he said, his voice quavering but resolute. "Away from the water. Away from them."

The rain continued to fall on the car's dented roof, a steady drumming that, for the first time in days, sounded like a victory song.

## Chapter 20: La Voz del Pastor

CHAPTER 20: The Shepherd's Voice

The stolen patrol car's wipers beat a hypnotic rhythm, cleaving the curtain of water that lashed down upon the country road. Inside, the air reeked of stale damp, synthetic upholstery, and the sour fear rising from Elías Varela's sodden clothes.

No words had passed between them since they left the waterfall's roar and the gunshots behind. Sarah drove with unwavering precision, her dark eyes fixed on the asphalt consumed by the headlights, while Elías, huddled in the passenger seat, held the compact digital recorder he'd found in the glove compartment, nestled among citation forms and crumpled maps. It bore a yellowed adhesive label in Inspector Valdés's spidery script: *EVIDENCE #4 - SACRISTY*.

Elías's finger hovered, trembling, over the play button. His injured leg throbbed with a dull cadence, a pulsating reminder of his own mortality, but that physical pain served as a necessary anchor. What truly terrified him was the device's silence.

"Do it," Sarah commanded. Her voice held no trace of compassion's gentleness, instead ringing with the hardness of tempered steel. "We need to know what we're up against. Or rather, who."

Elías pressed the button. Static hissed briefly before a voice filled the confined space. A voice that belonged to neither an anonymous mercenary nor a screaming zealot. It was a soft, cultured baritone, the very tone that had echoed through university lecture halls and private confessionals for twenty years.

*"...compassion is a luxury history cannot afford, Valdés. You seek human justice; I ensure eternal salvation. These are different currencies."*

The air fled Elías's lungs as if he'd been struck in the solar plexus.

*"The boy, Varela... he is an exquisite instrument,"* the recording continued, with that didactic rhythm Elías once admired. *"He possesses the mind of a 12th-century scribe trapped in a vulgar world. His loyalty lies with truth, and that makes him predictable. Manipulable. Once he deciphers the Codex, his usefulness will have expired. An academic martyr is often more valuable than a living professor."*

A lull settled over the recording, followed by the clink of porcelain against a saucer. A teacup. Monsignor Camiña always took Earl Grey tea at five o'clock.

*"Ensure it appears an accident, or better yet, a suicide driven by guilt. He already bears the weight of his previous mentor's destruction... a minor tragedy I had to orchestrate to prepare him for this moment. Pain purifies, Inspector. I have been shaping him for sacrifice since he was a student."*

Elías stopped the recording.

The silence that followed felt more savage than any detonation.

No shouts. No tears. Elías simply remained motionless, his gaze lost in the raindrops distorting the dashboard lights. An icy nausea crawled from his stomach to his throat. Twenty years. Every scholarship, every word of encouragement, every correction to his theses, even the scandal that had ruined his former professor and driven him into the Church's protective embrace... All had been an edifice of deceit. A grand design.

He wasn't the main player in his own story. He was livestock. A beast fattened on knowledge, destined for slaughter on the proper altar.

His hands rose to his face in an automatic gesture, seeking the frame of his glasses to adjust them, to bring reality into focus, but halted midway. His fingers clenched into a white, trembling fist. There was nothing to focus. The myopia lay not in his eyes, but in his soul.

"He..." Elías's voice was a broken thread, barely audible above the engine. "He gave me my first fountain pen. He paid for my mother's treatment when social security failed."

Sarah didn't take her eyes off the road, but her knuckles whitened on the steering wheel.

"Investments," she said. The word dropped like a verdict. "He bought your loyalty. He bought your mind."

"He said I was like a son."

"Abraham loved Isaac too, Elías. And yet, he still led him up the mountain to put a knife to his throat."

Elías doubled over, his forehead resting against the glove compartment's cold plastic. The pain of betrayal was physical, an internal laceration bleeding more than his leg. He felt small, foolish, a child playing with scrolls while adults sharpened knives in the dark. Bile burned his mouth. He wanted to open the door and vomit, or perhaps hurl himself onto the moving asphalt and end the charade.

The car gave a slight lurch as Sarah took a sharp bend too fast.

"Look at me," she commanded.

"Look at me, damn it!" Sarah slammed on the brakes at the verge, sending the tires shrieking on the wet gravel. The car stopped, but the engine still idled, roaring softly.

She swung in her seat, ignoring the confined space, and grabbed Elías by the lapels of his sodden tweed jacket. She shook him once, hard, forcing his head up.

"You are not permitted to shatter now," Sarah whispered, her face inches from his, her dark eyes burning with a fierce glow that starkly opposed his own deathly pallor. "If you break, he wins. If you surrender, you validate every word on that tape. You become the 'instrument' he claims you are."

"I can't..." Elías shook his head, tears of impotence mixing with the rainwater on his cheeks. "I'm a paleographer, Sarah. I read dead books. I don't know how to fight this. He is the Church. He is the system. He is my father."

"He is not your father. He is your master." Sarah released him, letting him fall back against the seat. "And slaves only have two options: die working or kill the master."

The word "kill" hung in the air, heavy and absolute. Elías looked at his hands. They bore indelible ink stains and fresh cuts from their flight. Hands that turned pages, not brandished weapons. But as he recalled Camiña's voice, that haughty complacency, something shifted within him. The chill of fear began to crystallize into something harder, sharper.

Camiña had orchestrated his mentor's downfall. Camiña had engineered his life like a rat's maze.

Elías took off his glasses. They were smudged, useless. He wiped them with the dry edge of his shirt but didn't put them back on immediately. He saw the world blurred, the lights unfocused.

"He has the Codex," Elías said. His voice sounded different. Deeper. Stripped of the trembling doubt from moments before. "Or at least, he believes he has the part that matters."

"We have the key pages," Sarah reminded him, patting her cargo pocket. "But we have nowhere to go. Valdés is hunting us. The mercenaries are hunting us. Camiña has eyes at every train station and airport."

"We're not running."

Sarah watched him, assessing the shift in his tone.

"What do you suggest? Surrender?"

"Camiña said my usefulness ends when I decipher the Codex." Elías put on his glasses. The world snapped back into focus, but it was no longer the same world. Now he saw the sharp edges, the shadows, the cracks. "He needs the culmination of the ritual. He needs the exact location within the Cathedral for whatever he plans to do during the solstice."

"We know where it is," Sarah said. "The hidden crypt beneath the Portico."

"Yes. And he'll be there. Waiting for the stars to align." Elías looked at the Codex on his lap, the ancient leather gleaming under the courtesy light. "If we want to survive, we can't run away. We have to go in. To the only place where he feels untouchable."

Sarah arched an eyebrow, a predatory smile curving her lips.

"Into the lion's den."

"To the Cathedral," Elías confirmed. "Tomorrow is the Pilgrim's Mass. There will be thousands of people. Tourists, worshippers, television cameras. It's perfect chaos."

"It's a fortress, Elías. There's private security, national police, and now his personal 'cleaners.' Going in there is suicide."

"It's the only place they can't shoot us without witnesses," he retorted, and for the first time, his analytical mind wasn't dissecting a text, but a strategy. "Camiña is arrogant. He believes I'm a frightened sheep who will run to hide in some academic burrow. He won't expect the sheep to return to the fold with sharpened teeth."

Elías took the digital recorder and tucked it into his pocket, close to his heart. That voice would fuel him.

"Are you sure you can do this?" Sarah asked, her tone now tinged with cautious respect. "Once we enter Santiago, there will be no turning back."

Elías looked through the windshield, toward the darkness of the road stretching north. Toward Compostela. He no longer felt the cold. He only felt the weight of history, and for the first time, it was not a burden. It was a weapon.

"He wrote my story for twenty years," Elías said, and his whisper sounded like the scratch of a quill on dry parchment. "It's time I wrote the ending."

Sarah nodded, once. She shifted into first gear, and the patrol car roared, its tires biting the asphalt with savage force. They spun onto the empty road, headlights sweeping the trees like blades of light, and accelerated back into the storm, toward the stone city where truth waited to be unearthed, or to bury them forever.

## Chapter 21: Retorno a la Ciudad Santa

CHAPTER 21: Return to the Holy City

The storm had turned the air into dirty, liquid glass, blurring the edges of Compostela's outskirts into muted grey watercolors. It wasn't the biblical deluge of the previous night, but a lingering dampness, a pervasive hang in the air that seeped past clothing, chilling one to the bone.

Valdés's car sat abandoned in an industrial park three kilometers from the old town, hidden behind a construction dumpster overflowing with debris.

Elías Varela stepped from the vehicle, his right leg buckling for an instant under gravity's pull. No throbbing pulse, no rhythmic pangs; the sensation was entirely mechanical, as though ligaments had been replaced by rusty cables that shrieked and seized without lubrication. He clenched his teeth, swallowing a groan, and forced himself to straighten his spine. The satchel holding the Codex felt weighted with granite slabs, not parchment.

"Can you walk?" Sarah Al-Fayed was already beside him, pulling up the hood of her stolen sweatshirt. Her dark eyes swept the perimeter with a military radar's efficiency.

"Just a minor structural defect," Elías lied, dragging his foot until it found purchase on the slick asphalt. "Adrenaline will be the mortar."

They walked towards the city's entrance, blending into the procession of shadows shuffling along the sidewalk. At that hour, the line between devout pilgrim and vagrant had vanished. Both groups trudged stooped, vanquished by miles, swathed in layers of plastic and synthetic fabrics reeking of stale damp.

Elías tried to peer through his glasses, but the lenses were useless ponds. Instead of cleaning them with his usual automatic gesture, he took them off and tucked them into his jacket's soaked pocket. The world blurred into an impressionistic smear, which, ironically, helped. Without sharp details, fear lost its edges.

Reaching the roundabout that marked the urban boundary, Sarah seized his arm, halting him abruptly behind a bus stop shelter.

"Shit," she breathed. Her voice held a blade's edge.

Elías squinted, his nearsighted eyes straining. Ahead, where the avenue emptied into the San Pedro district, swirling blue lights painted building facades with frantic strobe flashes. This was no routine checkpoint. Armored vans crisscrossed the roadway, and agents with long arms were silhouetted against the headlights.

"They're looking for the car," Elías said, his stomach clenching.

"No," Sarah corrected, pointing at a poster flapping wildly on a lamppost. "Look at the flags. Vatican and Spain."

Elías strained his gaze. The yellow and white banners, drenched and somber, declared what their seclusion in the safe house had kept them from knowing.

"*Visita Ad Limina*... or perhaps an extraordinary papal legate," he muttered, piecing together news snippets he'd dismissed weeks earlier. "The security isn't for us. It's for Him. Or whoever comes in His name."

"Tier one lockdown," Sarah assessed, measuring distances. "Identity checks at every main entrance to the old quarter. If we try to pass through with your 'deceased' paperwork and my face in the databases, we'll last less than a breath."

The paleographer studied the stone citadel rising in the distance, now an unyielding fortress. The irony bit deep: the very security meant to guard the faith now kept them from saving it. Yet then, a memory surfaced, not from books, but from 18th-century sanitation plans he'd examined for his thesis on monastic infrastructure.

"The city has veins not found on tourist maps," Elías said, turning towards a side alley stacked with empty fruit crates. "The old sewers. The conduits for the city's water supply."

"Elías, we can't crawl through filth with an open wound. Infection would kill you before Camiña ever could."

"I'm not talking about sewers. I mean the service passages under Rúa de San Pedro. Stonemasons used them to move materials without disrupting processions. If they haven't sealed them off from last year's construction..."

They plunged into the maze of back alleys. Here, the ground wasn't pristine asphalt but uneven cobblestone and mud. Elías led, limping, bracing himself against peeling walls to keep his footing. Each step sent an electric jolt from thigh to hip, an alarm his brain tried, and failed, to quiet.

They reached a low, rusted metal door, set into the base of a moss-laden retaining wall. It looked like an forgotten electricity meter access.

"The lock's modern," Sarah noted, kneeling before it. She pulled out the multi-tool knife she'd retrieved from the car. It wasn't a professional lockpick, yet her hands moved with surgical exactness, working the cylinder.

A dry click. The door gave way with a hinge-groan that echoed like a gunshot in the predawn silence.

They stepped inside. The air was thick, carrying a mineral taste of excavated earth and mildew. Sarah switched on her phone's flashlight, cupping the beam with her fingers to temper its brightness. The passage was narrow, barely a meter wide, flanked by pipes as thick as anacondas, weeping condensation.

They moved forward for twenty minutes that felt like hours. The ceiling dipped lower and lower, forcing Elías to hunch, intensifying the torment in his leg. His breathing turned ragged, a broken bellows in the dark.

"Stop," Sarah commanded, dousing the light.

Above, through a street-level ventilation grate, heavy boots struck stone. Metallic voices, warped by radio static.

"...southern perimeter secured. No incidents in the Platerías sector..."

They were directly beneath a patrol. Elías held his breath until his lungs burned. A drop of filthy water dripped from the grate, struck his cheek, and trickled to the corner of his lips like a black tear. They waited for the bootfalls to fade, swallowed by the ceaseless whisper of rain outside.

"We're inside the ring," Elías whispered, orienting himself by the acoustics and the floor's slope. "This should emerge near Plaza de Cervantes."

They pressed on until they found a vertical ladder, eaten away by time. Sarah ascended first, nudging the manhole cover with her shoulder. It didn't open onto a main street, but into the inner courtyard of an ancient city block.

They surfaced, gasping for fresh air. They stood in a blind alley, hemmed in by the rear walls of centuries-old buildings. White wooden galleries gazed into the void like closed eyes.

"Now what?" Sarah asked, wiping mud from her knees. "We can't wander until the Cathedral opens. We need a hideout."

Elías adjusted his satchel. He knew this courtyard. The scent of old paper, vanilla, and decaying dust was faint, nearly imperceptible under the rain, yet to his trained nose, it was unmistakable.

"I know someone," he said, gesturing towards a heavy oak door with a worn lion knocker, at the back of an ashlar stone building. "Don Aurelio. 'Vetusta Library'."

"Is he trustworthy?"

"He despises Camiña more than we do. The Monsignor tried to expropriate his incunabula collection a decade ago under a false ecclesiastical heritage bull. Aurelio keeps a shotgun behind the counter and nurses a bitter memory."

Elías rapped the knocker. Three spaced knocks, a code from his student days when he'd sought texts forbidden by the faculty.

Silence stretched taut. Sarah tensed her muscles, poised to run or fight. Then came the scraping of heavy bolts, one after another, like the layers of a security onion being peeled back.

The door cracked open a scant few inches, revealing a security chain and a watery eye, framed by deep wrinkles, glinting in the gloom.

"The shop's closed. Come back Monday or go to hell," rasped a voice that sounded like crumpled parchment.

"*Verba volant, scripta manent*," Elías quoted, his voice raw with exhaustion, leaning closer to the crack so the hall light could illuminate his features.

The eye widened dramatically. A stunned silence descended.

"Varela?" The whisper was steeped in disbelief. "We buried you yesterday. I saw your obituary in *El Correo*."

"The printing press was hasty, Aurelio. We need sanctuary."

The door slammed shut to unlatch the chain, then swung wide. An old man in a plaid flannel robe and leather slippers gestured them urgently inside.

The library's interior was an ordered chaos of physics-defying book towers, ceiling-high shelves, and the heady scent of ink and suspended time. It was a bunker of knowledge.

"Quick, to the cellar," Aurelio directed, bolting the door with trembling hands. "The police have been asking about strangers. They say terrorists are trying to disrupt the Pilgrim's Mass. They have snipers on the Fonseca rooftops."

Elías and Sarah descended a spiral staircase into the shop's depths. There, surrounded by 17th-century cartographic maps and forgotten theological tomes, Elías sank into a threadbare wingback chair. His leg now throbbed with renewed savagery, claiming payment for the effort expended.

Sarah leaned against a walnut table, watching Elías.

"We're in," she said, her tone not celebratory, but tactically assessing. "But with snipers and papal security, reaching the Botafumeiro will be like crossing a minefield."

"Chaos is our cloak," Elías replied, withdrawing the Codex from his satchel and setting it on the table with reverence. His ink- and mud-stained hands caressed the leather cover. "Camiña won't expect the dead to walk among the faithful."

Outside, the city stirred under the siege of rain and surveillance, unaware that in the cellar of an old bookshop, two fugitives had just breached the beast's heart.

## CHAPTER: 22 - The Belly of the Beast

The subterranean darkness held a physical weight, a mantle of decaying velvet that clung to the skin and hampered breathing. It wasn't merely the absence of photons, but an atmosphere heavy with centuries of human detritus and geological enigmas.

Elías Varela limped forward, each step a diplomatic negotiation between his will and the failing mechanics of his right leg. The injury no longer sent sharp distress signals; it had settled into a leaden stiffness, as though the tendons had morphed into overly taut piano wires, humming with a deep, sickening frequency whenever his boot struck the uneven ground. He leaned against the damp wall, feeling the cold slime seep through the tweed of his jacket, leaving a track of microscopic ooze on his shoulder.

"Mind your head," Sarah Al-Fayed whispered, a few paces ahead. Her flashlight's beam, pilfered from Aurelio's storehouse, sliced through the gloom like a scalpel through gangrenous flesh.

The tunnel sloped sharply downwards. They had left behind the nineteenth-century red brickwork, typical of Santiago's contemporary sewage system, to venture into something far older. The scent shifted; the chemical reek of detergents and urban drains receded, replaced by an earthy, mineral aroma of damp soil and fungi that had never seen the sun.

"Do you notice the change in acoustics?" Elías asked, his voice a mere scrape against the oppressive silence. He adjusted his spectacles on his sweaty nose, instinctively shielding the backpack cradling the Codex against his chest. "The echo is shorter. Harder stone."

"Granite," Sarah affirmed, pausing. She ran her hand over a cyclopean block that constituted part of the archway above. "*Opus quadratum*. We're entering the Roman infrastructure. Or what remains of it."

Elías drew closer, dragging his injured limb in a semi-circular arc to avoid bending it. Sarah's lamp illuminated the stone joints. There was no mortar. The engineering was faultless, designed to endure millennia.

"Legend holds that the original tomb lay in a Roman cemetery," the palaeographer murmured, tracing a finger over an eroded inscription. "*Compostela*. *Composita Tella*. Well-composed lands, or perhaps, burial ground. We have always walked upon the dead."

"Save the etymology lesson, Elías. Look at this."

Sarah pointed to the ground. The path narrowed, flanked by two deep channels where a trickle of black water flowed. Yet what caught the historian's eye wasn't the water, but the passage's architecture. The ceiling plunged sharply, and the walls exhibited a series of square perforations at regular intervals.

"They look like beam sockets," Elías remarked, straining his eyes in the gloom.

"They're not for support," Sarah corrected, her voice taking on that technical, cold edge she adopted when dissecting a perilous structure. "Look at the angle. They tilt downwards. And the floor... the central flagstones are slightly depressed."

The woman crouched, drawing her multi-tool knife from her pocket. With the tip, she scraped the seam between two large stone tiles. The metallic screech echoed with an eerie clarity.

"There's a hollow space below," she diagnosed, rising with a fluid grace Elías found enviable. "It's a pressure mechanism. If we step on the center, something trips."

"A trap?" Elías felt his mouth go dry. "In a Roman sewer?"

"This isn't just any sewer." Sarah aimed the light beam towards the tunnel's depths, where the darkness seemed to swallow the glow. "It's a defensive perimeter. Someone has kept this running. The joints are free of moss. Too clean."

Elías grasped the implication immediately. The "Heresy" wasn't merely an abstract theological concept; it had engineers. The Order didn't just guard books; it safeguarded physical access to the underworld.

"We have to keep close to the walls," Sarah commanded. "Put your feet where I put mine. Use the stone edges, not the center."

They began their crossing. For Elías, the maneuver was a Chinese water torture. Walking the narrow rim forced his compromised leg into angles it could no longer endure. Sweat ran down his forehead, fogging the lenses of his spectacles, blurring the world into a watercolor wash of grays and blacks. He felt the city's weight above him—tons of cathedral, plazas, and unwitting tourists—pressing down on the stone ceiling.

They had covered twenty meters when Elías's foot, betrayed by muscle fatigue and the slick slime, skittered.

It was an instant of lost gravitational hold. His right boot, the one on his injured side, slid from the safe edge and landed hard on the center of the forbidden flagstone.

*CLACK.*

The sound was mechanical, deep, like the bolt of a massive gate drawing shut in the earth's entrails.

"Elías!" Sarah cried, spinning around.

A guttural din answered from the tunnel's depths, behind them. It wasn't the clang of stone against stone, but the furious roar of nature unleashed.

"Water!" Sarah roared, her dark eyes mirroring panic for the first time. "It's a hydraulic sluice!"

The sound morphed into a liquid thunder. A wall of water, held back for an unknown duration in upper cisterns, surged towards them. The air was violently displaced, bringing with it a putrid wind that slapped their faces.

"Run!" Sarah seized his arm, tugging him with a force that defied any protocol of gentleness.

Elías strove to obey. His brain dispatched the command to flee, but his body functioned like a broken machine. Adrenaline flooded his system, temporarily numbing his leg's stiffness, allowing him to stumble onward.

The water reached their ankles in seconds. It was icy, a chilling bite that starkly opposed the warmth of his exertion. This was no sluggish inundation; it was a deluge engineered to purge the passage of intruders. The current tore at his trousers, weighty and savage.

"There!" Sarah pointed her flashlight ahead. The tunnel ended in a low arch, barely visible above the swiftly rising water level. "There's a climb!"

The water now reached their waists. The cold was crippling, siphoning away body heat with ruthless efficiency. Elías stumbled, briefly submerging himself in the murky broth. The tang of rust and decay filled his mouth. He spat and thrashed, feeling the backpack containing the Codex act as a fatal deadweight, dragging him downward.

A firm hand clasped the collar of his jacket. Sarah hauled him to the surface.

"Don't you dare drown now, academic!" she snarled, battling the current that threatened to slam them against the granite walls.

They reached the ultimate arch. The water rose relentlessly, striving to fill the tunnel's entire volume. Barely fifty centimeters of air remained between the turbulent surface and the keystone of the arch.

"We have to dive to get to the other side," Sarah shouted above the clamor of crashing water. "Take a breath!"

Elías gazed at the black water, a looking glass to his own mortality. There was no room for intellectual dread, only for mammalian instinct. He gulped a mouthful of stale air and submerged.

The world dissolved into a maelstrom of bubbles and darkness. He propelled himself with his arms, disregarding his knee's agonized protests. He felt the arch's stone graze his back. The current strove to drag him back, to eject him like a foreign body, but Sarah's hand remained clamped to his clothes, steering him onward, into the unknown.

They broke the surface on the other side, coughing and gasping like brutalized newborns.

Here, the ground sloped upward, a crude stone ramp lifting them from the flood's immediate reach. They scrabbled up the incline, fingernails gouging the wet rock, until the water settled below, a furious whirlpool battering the ceiling of the passage they had just traversed, sealing off the exit.

They lay sprawled on the cold stone, drenched, shivering uncontrollably. Elías rolled onto his back, his chest heaving with painful spasms. He removed his spectacles, now rendered useless by water and mud, and wiped them clumsily with the tail of his soaked shirt—a futile gesture, yet essential for his psyche.

"It was... it was engineered..." he gasped, his voice ragged from the lack of air and the intense cold. "No accident."

Sarah sat up, wringing water from her black braid. Her face was smeared with mud, but her eyes gleamed with a blend of fury and deference.

"Roman hydraulic engineering modified in the medieval era," she stated, spitting aside. "A kinetic trap. If the Order has guarded this for centuries, Elías... it means we're on the right track."

Elías peered into the darkness stretching before them, deeper, more hushed. His leg throbbed now with a fresh warmth, a covenant of future agony, but they were alive.

"Welcome to the Underworld," he whispered to himself, feeling his drenched clothes adhere to his skin like a second layer of dead epidermis.

## Chapter 23: La Cripta de los Sin Nombre

CAPÍTULO: 23 - The Crypt of the Nameless

The air thickened, laden with a rock-hewn stillness that bore no resemblance to the biting damp of the flooded tunnels. They had left behind the roar of water and its hydraulic traps, venturing into the parched depths of the hill. Elías Varela felt each step was a losing battle with his own body. His injured limb no longer sent warning signals; it had transformed into inert dead weight, a slab of concrete he had to drag across the uneven ground. He perceived no pain, only a mechanical detachment, as if his tendons were frayed ropes threatening to snap under the strain.

Beside him, Sarah Al-Fayed advanced, flashlight in one hand, knife in the other. Her breath was the sole metronome in that profound emptiness. The yellow light swept the walls, laying bare a shift in the architecture. The rough-hewn granite blocks of medieval times had vanished, replaced by flat, narrow bricks arranged in a flawless herringbone pattern.

“*Opus spicatum*,” Elías rasped, his voice a mere thread. His mind, seeking refuge from physical exhaustion, clung to academic analysis like a drowning man to a plank. “This is a late Roman structure. Third century, perhaps fourth. It shouldn’t exist beneath the Cathedral.”

“Save the lecture for the conference, Elías,” she cut in, though her tone held no bite; it was pure survival efficiency. “Do you see an exit?”

The beam of light spilled into a vast chamber. It was not a passage, but a rotunda. The ceiling vanished into the upper gloom, an invisible dome that returned the amplified, distorted echo of their footsteps. At the center of the circular room, the floor sloped gently toward an inverted *oculus*, a dry well meant for forgotten libations.

Elías paused, leaning his shoulder against the cold stonework. Sweat chilled on his back, pasting his shirt to his skin like a second dermis. He adjusted his backpack strap; the Codex’s weight, its vellum pages damp, seemed to have doubled, bowing his spine.

“It’s a mausoleum,” he whispered, grasping the place’s geometry. “A *cella memoriae*. They didn’t inter saints here, Sarah. They interred those the Church wished to forget, yet feared to erase.”

Sarah swept the light around the perimeter. Empty niches pocked the curved walls, black mouths in the reddish stone. There were no sarcophagi, no statues, only millennia of dust and a silence that pressed against their eardrums.

“There’s an opening on the other side,” she said, pointing the beam at a low arch at the opposite end. “If the heresy maps hold true, that connects to the Portico’s foundations.”

She stepped forward, then halted abruptly. Her body coiled, assuming a stance Elías, in his academic clumsiness, could only envy: knees bent, center of gravity low, poised for violence.

“What is it?” he asked, instinctively fogging his spectacles with his dirty cuff, a futile gesture that only smeared the grime.

“The air,” she said. “It’s stopped.”

Before Elías could process the fluid dynamics of her remark, the darkness stirred to life.

No war cry rang out, no rush of boots. Just the rustle of fabric on stone, a ripple in the shadows to Sarah’s left.

“*Ex umbra in solem*,” a deep voice, devoid of human inflection, echoed from everywhere and nowhere, harnessing the dome’s perfect acoustics.

Silas rose from the blackness as if a continuation of it.

He didn't run at them; he was simply there. The Pilgrim was not dressed like a modern man. His long, heavy, dark coat swallowed Sarah’s flashlight beam, making it hard to discern where the man ended and the gloom began. His pale, browless face hung in the stale air like a death mask.

Sarah reacted with fierce instinct. She spun on her heel and launched a side kick aimed at the intruder’s knee, seeking to disable him before he could close the distance.

But Silas wasn’t where her eyes said he was. With a fluid, almost liquid motion, he pivoted on one foot, letting Sarah’s attack cleave empty air.

“I was expecting you,” he said. His tone was conversational, terrifyingly calm. “I knew the rat would seek its deepest hole.”

Elías felt ice fill his stomach. This was not a chase; it was an appointment. Silas knew the route. Knew the history. Perhaps better than they did.

Sarah wasted no time in talk. She used her missed momentum to roll across the floor and gain distance, putting herself between Elías and the killer. She raised her knife, a pathetic shard of steel facing the gargantuan form that towered over them.

“Elías, run for the arch!” she cried, her voice echoing off the curved walls.

Elías tried to obey. His brain issued an imperative to his legs: *move*. But his body was a crippled vehicle. As he shifted weight onto his right leg, his knee buckled without warning, as if the bone had dissolved. He pitched forward onto the stone floor, the impact knocking the wind from him. His glasses flew off, skittering across the uneven surface.

The world became an impressionistic blur of shadows and violent light.

“Faith without works is dead,” Silas pronounced, advancing on Sarah.

Elías, blindly fumbling the floor, retrieved his spectacles and jammed them crookedly onto his face. What he saw curdled his blood.

Sarah lunged to attack, not by choice, but by necessity. She knew brute strength was a losing game, so she chose speed. She swept the knife in a low arc, aiming for Silas’s tendons, then shifted upward, targeting his throat. These were trained motions—precise, lethal.

Silas met her with the indifference of a mountain facing rain.

He caught Sarah’s wrist with a bare hand, the sound of flesh on bone ringing dry and savage through the crypt. With his other hand, he struck the historian’s chest—a short, compact blow, yet carrying the force of a hydraulic piston.

Sarah flew backward, air leaving her lungs in a choked gasp. The flashlight clattered across the floor, spinning a dizzying carousel of shadows. The beam illuminated fragments of the scene: Silas’s boot, Sarah’s hand scraping stone, the stark terror etched on Elías’s face.

“Leave her!” the paleographer cried. His voice sounded pathetic, utterly without authority. He scrabbled for a weapon, a rock, anything. His fingers met only dust and shards of broken pottery.

Silas didn’t even glance at him. He strode toward Sarah, who was trying to rise, coughing, gasping for breath. The killer moved unhurriedly. No sadism marked his actions, only the grim efficiency of a task. He was a butcher nearing his stock.

Sarah managed to push to her knees and launched one final, desperate assault, aiming to plunge the knife into the giant’s thigh. Silas caught her arm in mid-air, twisting it with sickening ease until the steel clattered to the floor with a metallic chime, a sound like a death knell.

Then, he seized her by the jacket collar and lifted her from the floor. Sarah’s feet thrashed in the void, her hands beating uselessly against the granite forearms that choked her.

Silas turned slowly toward Elías. The flashlight’s beam on the floor cast the killer’s shadow high on the curved wall, a monstrous silhouette that seemed to consume the entire mausoleum.

“The Word became flesh,” Silas said, tightening his hold fractionally. Sarah let out a gurgling sound, her bloodshot black eyes searching for Elías’s. “But the flesh is weak.”

Elías tried to stand, but his legs were rags. He dragged himself backward, his back scraping against the niche’s cold wall. He hugged the backpack to his chest, feeling the hard edges of the Codex through the damp fabric. The book, his academic salvation, was now the dead weight dragging them down.

Silas took a step toward him, hauling Sarah like a broken doll. The woman’s face was purpling, her breathing choked by the pressure on her windpipe.

“You possess something that isn’t yours, scribe,” Silas’s voice was a guttural whisper that pierced to the bone. “Something sacred, stained by your profane hands.”

Elías looked at Sarah. Life was slipping from her. The daring, the strength, the vigor that defined her, guttering out beneath the pressure of those white, scarred fingers.

“The book,” Silas demanded, extending his free hand. The open, expectant palm contrasted sharply with the violence of his other hand. “Give me the Word, and I will spare the sinner.”

Time shattered. Elías could hear the distant drip of water, the deafening throb of his own heart in his ears, the rustle of Sarah’s clothes as she fought for air.

His analytical mind, forever searching for patterns and logical solutions, crashed against a wall. There was no intellectual escape. No puzzle to untangle to defuse the situation. The history he loved so dearly, the texts he revered, were now reduced to a primitive, brutal transaction.

If he surrendered the Codex, the Order won. The truth of Prisciliano, of the Way, of Santiago’s founding lie, would vanish forever into the pyres of dogma. His career, his mentor’s memory, everything he had fought for, would be lost.

But if he didn’t...

Sarah’s eyes met his. No longer was there a plea in them, only a terrified, knowing farewell.

“Elías...” she tried to utter, but only a strangled sound emerged.

Silas squeezed tighter. A subtle snap, cartilage under strain, filled the crypt’s silence.

“Choose,” the Pilgrim said, his impassive face lit from below by the fallen flashlight, giving him the aspect of a medieval demon on a Last Judgment altarpiece. “The dead truth or the living lie. You have three seconds before I break her neck.”

Elías Varela, a man who favored parchment over people, felt the world narrow to that single focal point. The crypt’s chill sank into his bones, deeper than ever. The backpack in his arms felt like a ton. The choice he stood on the brink of making would not only define his future but stain his soul with an indelible ink, far darker than what smudged his middle finger.

“One,” Silas counted.

Elías opened his mouth, but no sound came out. The paralysis of terror had pinned him to the necropolis floor, a useless observer at the execution of his sole ally.

## Chapter 24: Doce Horas de Oscuridad

CAPÍTULO: 24 - Twelve Hours of Darkness

The first toll of the Berenguela bell wasn't heard; it was a physical shock. A tectonic tremor that surged through the granite of the Clock Tower, pierced Elías’s worn soles, and rattled his very bones like dust upon a drum.

Five in the morning. Or perhaps six. Time had dissolved in the inky blackness of the spiral staircase.

Elías Varela lay curled up in the highest recess of the bell tower, a pigeon-filled nook buffeted by freezing gusts. He had managed to drag himself up, driven by the raw terror the body secretes once the mind gives way. His right leg, that limb now alien to him, no longer throbbed sharply. The pain had morphed into a molten lead weight, a feverish rigidity that rendered every inch of swollen skin a prison of taut flesh.

He was alone.

This truth struck him not as a thought, but as a physical lurch. Sarah wasn’t keeping watch at the entrance. There was no steady breathing, no whispered sarcasms to cut the tension. Only the Galician wind howled through the archways, bringing with it the horizontal rain that lashed his flimsy shelter.

He looked at his hands. They were black with grime, dried blood, and ancient ink. Trembling, he fumbled in the pocket of his tweed jacket, now rent and reeking of crypt damp. He drew out a crumpled handkerchief and, with mechanical motions, scrubbed his spectacle lenses. It did little good; the grease and dust merely shifted, leaving milky halos at the edge of his sight. He settled them back on, feeling the cold frame bite the bridge of his nose.

“Think,” he croaked. His own voice sounded alien, cracked from thirst and disuse. “You’re an academic. This is a translation problem. Nothing more.”

He hauled the backpack onto his lap. The movement sent an electric lash from his ankle to his groin, forcing his eyes shut and his teeth to grind until his jaw cracked. He took a deep breath, sucking in the storm’s metallic air, and pulled out the Codex.

The book seemed to weigh more than before. The crypt’s damp had softened the edges of its leather cover, and the reek of stale vellum hit his nostrils, an aroma that used to comfort him in the library’s security but now churned his gut.

He flicked on the small flashlight, its beam starting to flicker, moribund.

He turned the pages with a sick reverence. He knew the text, but until then he had read it as a historian seeks dates and names. Now, he had to read it as a man hunting for a weapon.

He paused at the illuminated folio depicting the *Lapis Stellarum*. The illustration, wrought with lapis lazuli and gold pigments, displayed an irregular, dark stone encircled by wavy lines that experts had always taken for a divine halo or sacred light.

Elías brought his nose close to the page, squinting his nearsighted eyes past the grimy lenses.

The adjacent text, scrawled in corrupt twelfth-century Latin, detailed the relic’s properties.

*“Non est de hoc mundo”* (It is not of this world).
*“Ignis qui non lucet”* (Fire that does not shine).

His finger, stained with indelible ink, traced the marginal gloss, hurried jottings from a terrified monk nine centuries past.

*“Those who keep it lose their hair and teeth. The skin blackens and sloughs off bloodlessly. The bone sickness wastes the chosen before the third moon.”*

Elías stopped short. His mind, honed to link disparate data, began to spin at a dizzying pace, ignoring the chill and exhaustion.

They had always presumed the deaths of the original Priscilianists and sect members were due to purges, poisonings, or divine retribution. History spoke of a “sacred plague” that struck only high-ranking initiates, those allowed into the *Sanctum Sanctorum*.

“Fire that does not shine…” he whispered.

He read on. Another property came to light.
*“The stone sings to iron. It draws the mariner’s needle and disorients birds.”*

Magnetism.

Elías slumped against the stone wall, breathing out a cloud of vapor. It all aligned with a brutal, anachronistic scientific logic. The *Lapis Stellarum* was no gem. No giant sapphire, no black diamond.

It was a meteorite.

And not just any space rock. One composed of heavy elements, intensely magnetic, and, most terrifying of all, radioactive.

Elías pictured medieval monks finding that smoking object in a crater, attributing divine origin to it because it had, literally, fallen from the sky along the path of the Milky Way. They would have encased it in a lead or thick gold reliquary, not for protection from radiation—a concept unknown to them—but out of reverence, which had, ironically, spared many lives.

But when they brought it out for rituals… when they bared themselves to its “invisible light”...

“Marie Curie in the twelfth century,” he murmured, a hysterical laugh bubbling in his throat.

Silas wasn't after God. He was after an unshielded, natural nuclear reactor.

Elías looked at the diagram again. The wavy lines encircling the stone were no sacred light. They were a primitive attempt to depict the unseen, the emission that killed without contact. The monk who sketched this likely perished soon after, his hands ulcerated and his body devoured by tumors.

This grasp gave him an icy clarity. The dread of immediate death, of Silas appearing on the stairs with his curved knife, melted away, displaced by cold calculation.

Elías Varela couldn't fight. His body was a useless dead weight, a collapsed structure barely capable of standing. If he tried to descend, Silas would ensnare him. If Silas climbed up, he'd kill him.

But knowledge… knowledge was the sole lever that could move the world. Or halt it.

The assassin wanted the exact location. He wanted the relic to “purify.” Elías knew where it lay. And now he knew *what* it was. If Silas found the stone without proper caution, the object itself would be his executioner, though it would take days or weeks to claim him. Too long. Sarah didn't have weeks.

He needed to wield that truth now.

He forced himself upright. The effort tore a groan from him, his right leg protesting with an inner blaze, as if the ligaments were violin strings stretched to breaking. He leaned on the sill of the bell tower’s aperture.

Below, Santiago de Compostela stirred beneath the grey veil of dawn. The slate roofs gleamed with rain, heedless of the drama transpiring high above.

Elías snapped the Codex shut. The sound echoed through the small stone chamber, vying with the wind.

He was no longer the frightened librarian who polished his spectacles to shrink from the world. Or at least, he couldn't afford to be. He held the answer to the ultimate enigma. He knew why the tomb had been sealed with lead, not stone. He knew why the entrance was scored with “danger” symbols the Church had reinterpreted as “holiness.”

He carried the key to death in his pack.

And Silas desired it.

Elías adjusted his scarf, a futile gesture against the bone-deep chill, yet necessary to feel a flicker of normalcy. He checked that the digital recorder was still in his pocket, a reassuring weight.

He would descend. Not to flee, but to invite the devil to dance.

Another bell toll made the floor tremble, marking the quarter-hour. The sound was deeper, more somber. To Elías, it sounded like a pronouncement, but for the first time all night, he wasn't certain if the pronouncement was for him.

“Come find me,” he said to the emptiness, and this time, his voice did not waver.

## Chapter 25: The Cell of Oblivion

The ceaseless dripping was a form of Chinese torture in the darkness. *Plink*. A hollow second. *Plink*. The sound echoed off the limestone walls, magnified by the cell's arched structure, boring into Sarah Al-Fayed's temple. Her wrists burned, abraded by the coarse hemp that bound her to a rusted iron ring set into the wall. The subterranean damp seeped into her bones, mingling with the chill of her sodden clothes, transforming every breath into an intake of mildew and stagnant time.

No windows broke the gloom. Only an oil lamp sat on a worm-eaten wooden table, casting long, dancing shadows that stretched like specters, reaching to choke her.

The oak door, fortified with black metal bands, groaned as it swung open.

Monsignor Camiña entered with the measured pace of one stepping into his private library, not a dungeon. His black cassock seemed to drink the meager light, leaving only his pale face and fine, well-tended hands hovering in the dimness. He dragged a three-legged stool forward and settled before her, just beyond her reach, lacing his fingers in his lap with an ecclesiastical calm that proved more chilling than Silas's physical brutality.

“Discomfort is vital for mental clarity, Doctor Al-Fayed,” Camiña murmured. His voice, a soft, cultivated baritone accustomed to the acoustics of confessional booths, carried no harshness. “The body must suffer so the spirit may speak.”

Sarah spat onto the ground, landing near the priest's immaculate boots. Her mouth felt foul, tasting of bile and dread.

“Spare me the medieval sermon.” Her voice emerged hoarse, yet steady. She forced her lungs to swell against the pressure on her ribs. “I know what you're seeking. I know what the *Lapis Stellarum* is.”

Camiña tilted his head, regarding her with the detached curiosity of an entomologist studying a beetle that resists the pin.

“Knowing and comprehending are two shores of the same river, separated by a chasm of ignorance.” He leaned forward; the lamp's glow caught two orange pinpricks in his pupils. “You see a rock, a meteorite, a geological oddity that emits energy. You see data, carbon dating, mineral composition. Science.”

“I see a poison that has slain people for centuries,” Sarah retorted, tensing her forearms. The rope bit into her flesh, but she detected a faint loosening. The damp was swelling the natural fibers. She needed to keep him speaking. Her analytical mind shifted from panicked paralysis to cold calculation. “I see radiation. I see death.”

“I see the proof of God,” he corrected, a conviction in his tone that chilled the cell's stale air. “The *Mysterium Tremendum*. Divinity is no warm embrace, Doctor. It is fire. It is pure power that consumes unworthy flesh. That stone dropped from the sky when Santiago was still a pagan star field. The Church did not conceal it out of greed, but out of mercy.”

Sarah ceased struggling for a moment, genuinely disoriented by the man's convoluted reasoning.

“Mercy? You've murdered to guard it.”

“The common folk need mystery, not truth,” Camiña rose and began to pace the narrow confines, his steps muffled by the packed earth floor. “If we give them scientific truth, if we tell them the 'curse' is a natural atomic reaction, magic dies. Faith transmutes into physics. And without reverent awe for the inexplicable, the Church loses its foundation. We need the stone to remain a terrifying miracle, not a biological hazard.”

Sarah seized the moment he turned his back to rotate her left wrist. Her thumb bone ground against the knot as she twisted the joint. The pain proved sharp, a white-hot needle climbing her arm, but she swallowed it whole, making no sound. The rope, aged and saturated with ambient moisture, gave a millimeter.

“You’re a cynic,” she launched, probing for a chink in his ideological armor. “You don't guard faith. You guard your power. You fear people discovering your 'God' is merely a radioactive rock.”

Camiña halted abruptly and pivoted. For the first time, his mask of serenity fractured, exposing a flash of irritation.

“I protect the very structure upholding the West. Chaos is the enemy, Doctor. And absolute truth—the kind your friend Elias seeks—is the most potent agent of chaos that exists.”

“Elias is a better man than you,” Sarah stated, pinning the priest with her dark gaze. “He seeks light to illuminate, you to blind. That’s why you fear him.”

The mention of Elias elicited an unforeseen reaction. Camiña’s shoulders slumped fractionally. He removed his rimless spectacles and polished them with a silk handkerchief drawn from his sleeve—a gesture so human, so mundane, it felt obscene in that setting.

“There is no fear, Sarah. There is… disappointment.” He resettled his spectacles and peered at the closed door, as if he could penetrate the wood and stone to where Elias Varela might be fighting for his life. “Elias was my finest pupil in the seminary, two decades past. He possessed a brilliant, voracious mind. He might have become a Prince of the Church.”

Sarah felt a lurch in her gut. That connection appeared in no dossier.

“You were his mentor?”

“I taught him to read the palimpsests of the human soul.” Camiña approached once more, encroaching on her personal space. He smelled of expensive soap and aged paper. “But he harbored a fatal flaw: a bourgeois, petty morality. He believed history belonged to everyone. He did not grasp that knowledge is a weapon, and one does not hand a loaded weapon to a child.”

“So you’re going to kill your 'finest pupil'?” Sarah whispered. As she spoke, she abraded the rope against the stone's jagged edge behind her back. *Scritch, scritch*. The sound vanished beneath her words.

“What grieves me is not his death, but the squandering of his potential,” Camiña said, his voice tinged with melancholy. “It is a necessary tragedy. Like that of Abraham and Isaac, but without the angel to stay the knife. He chose truth; I chose the Church. We cannot coexist.”

The priest checked a silver pocket watch. The click of the case shutting rang like a gunshot in the chamber.

“Silas will deliver the Codex shortly. And with it, Elias’s head. I suggest you employ this interval to reflect on which side of history you wish to occupy: that of the forgotten martyrs, or of the silent survivors.”

Camiña turned toward the exit. Before stepping across the threshold, he paused, but did not glance back.

“I will pray for your soul, Doctor. Though I doubt it will avail much.”

The door slammed shut with a heavy thud, followed by the screech of the external bolts.

Sarah was left alone again in the gloom. The dripping resumed. *Plink*. *Plink*.

Yet something had shifted. Camiña's admission had not broken her; it had furnished her with a tool. She knew the priest viewed himself as a stern father, not a monster. He possessed an ego. And he harbored an emotional bond with Elias, twisted as it was. That could be exploited.

She expelled all the air from her lungs, contracting her chest, and yanked her left hand with brute force. The skin of her wrist tore, leaving a track of warm blood that slicked the hemp. She clenched her teeth until her jaw ached, ignoring the blaze in her nerves.

The knot, weakened by the damp and the constant abrasion during their exchange, yielded.

Her left hand came free.

Sarah stared at it, trembling, her fingers numb and stained with red and grime. It was not a complete triumph—her feet remained bound, and the door secured—but absolute despair had yielded to a cold, keen possibility.

“Pray for yourself, Camiña,” she whispered into the darkness, flexing her fingers to restore her circulation. “Because when I get out of here, I’m writing the history.”

## CHAPTER 26: The Inspector's Gambit

The air within the Santiago Police Station held the oppressive weight of stagnant water. It reeked of burnt coffee, stale tobacco clinging to the curtains, and that pervasive Galician dampness even the central heating couldn't chase away. Inspector Valdés drew a red line across the map spread on his desk, the marker pen screeching against the glossy paper like a muffled cry.

His nicotine-stained fingers trembled faintly. It wasn't fear, he told himself, but the thrum of an engine idling at high speed.

"Rivas, close the door," he ordered without looking up from the Cathedral map.

The sergeant obeyed. The latch clicked shut with finality, sealing off the office from the administrative murmur outside. Within, three officers of his absolute trust awaited, dark-uniformed statues, their faces taut with anticipation.

"We have a pressing danger in the temple's subsoil," Valdés rapped the map with his knuckle. "This isn't theory. Professor Varela and Doctor Al-Fayed are down there. And they're not alone."

"Entry order, Chief?" Rivas inquired, a man broad as an oak and of few words.

"I'm filing the paperwork. But time is against us. I want a discreet perimeter at the crypt exits and the Portico of Glory. No sirens."

The phone on the desk began to ring. The jarring sound cleaved the heavy air. Valdés eyed the device as if it were a viper poised to strike. He knew who was calling before he even picked it up.

"Valdés," he answered, his voice a dry rasp.

"Inspector." The tone on the other end was soft, polite. And precisely for that reason, treacherous. It was Superintendent Corrales, a bureaucrat who spent more time at dinners with the Archbishopric than out on the streets. "I'm informed you're mobilizing resources toward Obradoiro Square."

Valdés gripped the receiver until his knuckles blanched.

"I have sound reasons to believe civilians are at risk, sir. A potential hostage situation or worse in the catacombs."

"What you have is conjecture and an overactive imagination, Inspector." There was a pause, the rustle of papers on the other end of the line. "The Archbishopric has voiced its apprehension about any... visible disruption before tonight's ceremony. The Church's image is the city's image."

"There are lives at stake, damn it!"

"There are protocols, Valdés. And hierarchies." The voice hardened, shedding its false politeness. "Cancel the operation. I don't want a single uniform in Obradoiro without my explicit authorization. Am I clear?"

Valdés tasted metal in his mouth. The bile of powerlessness.

"Crystal clear, sir."

He replaced the receiver with a gentleness that belied the fury searing his gut. The office sank into an absolute stillness, broken only by the electric hum of the fluorescent lights. His men watched him, awaiting his verdict. Rivas's jaw was clenched; he knew how to read his superior's silences.

Valdés ran a hand over his face, rubbing his tired eyes. Bureaucracy. That, not the curved-knife killer or the religious fanatics, was Valdés's true adversary: the stamped paperwork, the courteous calls that bound the hands of those meant to act.

He gazed at his badge on the table. Then he looked at Rivas.

"Officially, we're drafting reports on traffic in the southern zone," Valdés said in a low voice, almost a whisper.

Rivas's eyes glinted. A wry smile, barely a twitch, crossed his face.

"Understood, chief. Traffic's terrible today."

"I want two unmarked cars. Plain clothes," Valdés stood, grabbing his trench coat from the stand. His movement was fluid, resolute, erasing the hesitancy that had gripped him moments earlier. "Kevlar vests beneath your jackets. Sidearms, no rifles that draw notice."

"What if they ask?" the youngest officer, García, queried, a thread of nervousness in his voice.

"If they ask, we're off-duty, having coffee at the Hostal de los Reyes Católicos." Valdés yanked open his desk drawer and extracted an extra box of ammunition, sliding it into his pocket. "But if I'm right, and I pray I'm wrong, no one will care about our schedules."

They left the station through the back door, into rain that fell like a lead curtain over Santiago. The cold water struck Valdés's face, rousing him fully. He slid into the driver's seat of his old grey sedan, the steering wheel's leather cool beneath his palms. Rivas settled beside him, checking his pistol's magazine with precise, practiced movements.

The drive towards the old quarter became a battle against the windshield wipers, which fought the downpour to no avail. The cobblestone streets gleamed like fish scales beneath the jaundiced headlights.

Nearing the monumental zone, traffic stalled. Blue barriers and local police officers barred the main approach. The ecclesiastical event had transformed the center into an impregnable fortress for the common citizen.

"They won't let us through the main checkpoint," Rivas murmured, watching the officers redirecting traffic.

"We're not asking permission."

Valdés wrenched the wheel sharply right, forcing the car down a narrow alley reserved for residents and services. The second vehicle, driven by García, tailed them bumper to bumper.

"Put on your sunglasses," Valdés commanded.

"Chief, it's raining, and it's practically night with these clouds."

"Do it."

Rivas obeyed. Valdés floored it when he saw an opening in the line of black official cars entering through a side access to the Parador. He clung to the tail of a limousine bearing diplomatic flags, mimicking the aggressive, confident driving of an official escort.

The barrier guard hesitated for a second. He saw two dark cars, men in shades with grim faces, pressed tight against a VIP vehicle. His hesitation sealed his defeat. He raised a hand in a martial salute and waved them through, assuming they were part of the unlisted security detail.

They rolled into Obradoiro Square.

The vast open space unfurled before them, monumental and overwhelming. The Cathedral's baroque facade loomed against the grey sky, its spires scraping the low clouds, draped in scaffolding and tarpaulins that concealed the restoration work, lending it the aspect of a wounded, bandaged beast.

Valdés parked the car in an unobtrusive corner, near the Pazo de Raxoi, away from the television cameras already being set up. He killed the engine. The drum of rain on the roof filled the cabin.

"We're in," he said, looking toward the immense stone edifice. He knew that somewhere, beneath those tons of granite and centuries of history, Elias and Sarah fought for breath.

Rivas removed his sunglasses and looked at his inspector.

"Now what?"

Valdés drew his sidearm, checked the chamber, and returned it to his shoulder holster. His gaze hardened, taking on the edge of tempered steel. There was no turning back now. If he was wrong, his career would end that very afternoon. If he was right, his life might.

"Now we wait for the stone to speak," Valdés declared. "And when it does, we'll be ready to answer."

## Chapter 27: Sacrificio de Papel

CHAPTER 27 - A Sacrifice of Paper

The uneven echo of his own steps was the sole liturgy filling the central nave. Elías Varela limped forward, dragging his injured leg across granite flagstones worn smooth by millions of soles before his. The pain in his thigh wasn't sharp; instead, a dull throb, a wave of molten lead, surged and receded with each shift of weight, a constant reminder of his physical frailty within that stone temple.

The Cathedral, emptied of tourists and worshippers by the security protocols Camiña had engineered, felt obscene in its vastness. Bereft of whispered prayers, the edifice reclaimed its true nature: not a house of mercy, but a stronghold built to cow the human spirit. Far above, the storm’s drumming on the lead roofs mimicked an army on the march in the distance, a relentless siege that filtered a sickly, grey light through the lofty stained-glass windows.

Elías halted directly beneath the crossing. Above him, the immense rope of the Botafumeiro hung, slack as a hangman's noose awaiting its victim.

“Punctuality is a bourgeois virtue, Doctor Varela, yet appreciated all the same.”

Monsignor Camiña's voice rose from the ambulatory, amplified by the Romanesque architecture's flawless acoustics. The priest stepped from the High Altar's shadows, his black cassock drinking in the faint illumination. He looked less like a man of faith and more like the manager of a morally bankrupt corporation. His hands were clasped behind his back, his bearing that of a host greeting a guest in his private parlor, not in the house of God.

Elías clenched his jaw. Cold sweat plastered his shirt to his back beneath the tweed jacket. His right hand, hidden inside the leather satchel slung across his chest, quivered. Not from fear of death, but from the act he was about to commit: a sacrilege against his very essence.

“Where is she?” Elías asked, his voice raw, stripped of the authority it typically held in university lecture halls.

Camiña descended the chancel steps with infuriating slowness.

“Impatience, on the other hand, is a fault of youth. Or of desperation.” The prelate stopped ten paces away. “First, the offering. The Codex Calixtinus does not belong in lay hands, much less those of a disgraced academic.”

Elías withdrew his hand from the satchel. He held no weapon, at least not a conventional one. He drew out the sheaf of parchments, the very heart of the mystery that had cost blood and centuries to conceal. But something was amiss. The vellum, normally a dry cream hue, gleamed with an unnatural dampness. Transparent beads trickled down the pages' ragged edges, striking the stone floor with a barely perceptible patter.

A chemical scent, sharp and volatile, assailed the nave’s stagnant air. Pure ethanol. The very same Elías used in his restoration kit to clean tools, now saturating every fiber of the historic document.

Camiña's nose wrinkled. His composure fractured for a fleeting moment.

“What have you done?” His tone dropped an octave, shedding its feigned cordiality.

“Twelfth-century iron gall ink is remarkably resilient,” Elías said, surprised to find his voice steady as he spoke of chemistry and conservation. “But parchment is skin. Animal fat. And soaked in ninety-six percent alcohol… it makes for an excellent fuse.”

With his left hand, clumsy and damp, he drew a red plastic lighter from his trouser pocket. It was a common, cheap object, unworthy of the setting’s grandeur, yet in that instant, it held more sway than any bishop's crozier.

“Bring her,” Elías commanded. He thumbed the lighter’s wheel.

Camiña stared at the drenched book, a blend of horror and covetousness warring in his eyes. For a man who had given his life to guard the secret held within those pages, seeing them poised at the edge of annihilation was physical torment. He gave a terse nod toward the gloom of the north transept.

From the shadows, where stone turned to blackness, a massive figure emerged. Silas. The Pilgrim moved with a predatory grace that belied his bulk, his tactical boots making no sound on the granite. He dragged someone along.

Sarah. Her hands were bound behind her with plastic zip ties. Her leather jacket was torn at the shoulder, and a dark bruise bloomed on her left cheekbone, partly obscuring her eye. She stumbled forward, compelled by Silas's iron grip on the nape of her neck, but as she looked up and saw Elías, her one unimpaired eye blazed with lucid fury. No plea resided in her gaze, only shrewd assessment.

Silas yanked her back roughly, silencing her with a press to her throat. The pale giant fixed Elías with icy eyes, unconcerned by the drama, awaiting the command to execute or release. To him, the whole affair was merely a bureaucratic formality of faith.

Elías felt his world narrow into a tunnel, containing only Sarah's bruised face and the reek of alcohol wafting from the book in his grasp. History carried weight, yes, but life carried more. That was the axiom he had taken forty years to grasp.

“The book for the girl,” Elías declared, lifting the dripping codex. The flammable fluid ran down his wrist, stinging his skin, a keen reminder of the peril. “If Silas takes another step toward me, I ignite it. If you don't release her, I ignite it. If I doubt for a moment we’ll get out of here, I'll reduce it to ash before the smoke reaches the dome.”

Elías's thumb caressed the lighter wheel. *Click*. A spark flew, but no flame caught.

The sound cracked like a dry shot in the silence.

Camiña stepped forward, hands raised in a placating gesture that fooled no one.

“Careful, Doctor Varela. You hold the sole proof of the true history of the West. Burn it, and you demolish more than paper. You demolish truth. Can your historian's conscience bear that?”

“History is written by the survivors,” Elías countered, quoting a cynical truth he had always loathed but now embraced as a shield. “And I intend for her to survive.”

He spun the wheel again. This time, a yellow and blue tongue of flame sprang from the lighter's nozzle, dancing ravenously in the vapor-laden air. Elías brought the flame perilously close to the lower corner of the sheaf. The heat licked his fingers, yet he did not flinch.

Camiña's face tightened, the lines deepening into a mask of raw hatred. He glanced at the fire, then at Sarah, and last into Elías's tired gray eyes behind the smudged lenses. He realized it was no bluff. Elías Varela, the bookworm, the man who feared his own shadow, stood ready to commit the greatest academic sin conceivable.

“Release her, Silas,” Camiña hissed. The command slithered from his lips as if he were spitting venom.

The giant offered no challenge. He simply opened his hand. Sarah stumbled forward, regaining her balance with a gasp. She didn't run. Slowly, she turned, rubbing her still-bound wrists against her back, then sidled toward Elías, her gaze fixed on the killer.

“The exchange will happen simultaneously,” Camiña said, extending an impatient hand, palm upward. “You retreat toward the Puerta de Platerías. You leave the book on the crossing floor. We will not hinder your departure.”

Elías kept the flame lit. The lighter gas hissed softly.

“Sarah, move toward the door,” he murmured without looking at her, his gaze locked on the Codex and the small gap between it and the flame.

“I won't leave you,” she whispered as she brushed past him. The scent of stale sweat and fear she gave off mingled with the clinical aroma of alcohol.

“You aren't leaving me. You're giving me room to maneuver. Go.”

Sarah hesitated for a moment, gauging the geometry of potential violence in the hall, then gave an imperceptible nod. She began backing toward the south exit, her boots scuffing on stone dampened by leaks.

Elías stood alone before the two men. Fire in his right hand, the soaked book in his left. He stood at the heart of the crossing, the very core of Spanish Christendom, holding both heresy and purification in his hands.

“The book, Varela,” Camiña urged, taking a cautious step forward. Silas tensed, poised to spring. “You've won. You have the girl. Don't do anything foolish.”

Elías gazed at the parchment. The Latin words, penned by dead hands nine centuries ago, seemed to hum beneath the alcohol's film. *Liber Sancti Iacobi*. The truth about Prisciliano, about the dark stars, about the foundational lie.

Slowly, Elías crouched, groaning as his injured leg protested the bend. He set the book on the floor, with the tenderness a mother might show laying a child in its crib, even though he was about to surrender it to his adversary.

He straightened, holding the lighter aloft.

“Back,” Camiña warned Silas with a dismissive wave. “Leave it.”

Elías retreated, step by step, limping toward Sarah, who waited beneath the arch of the south exit. Camiña pounced on the book like a famished animal, kneeling on the cold stone, his dignity forgotten. His hands grazed the damp parchment, assessing the damage, his fingers stroking the ink as though it were wounded flesh.

Silas remained standing, an unmoving watchtower, watching his prey withdraw.

As they reached the doorway's threshold, Elías extinguished the lighter. Darkness seemed to plunge upon them once more, broken only by the distant light Camiña cast with a small flashlight onto the recovered book.

“Do you think they'll let us go?” Sarah whispered, her breath ragged against Elías's ear.

“No,” he replied, feeling the adrenaline sour in his gut. “Camiña has what he wants. Now we're loose ends.”

Elías glanced back one last time. The prelate remained engrossed in the text, but Silas was already turning his head, assessing the distance, the timing, and the pursuit's trajectory. The bargain was done. The hunt resumed.

“Run,” Elías said, shouldering open the heavy wooden door that led to the Plaza de Platerías. “Run as if hell itself were at your heels. Because it is.”

## CHAPTER 28: Fire on the Altar

The click of the Zippo's steel wheel against its flint didn't sound like a prelude, but a death knell.

The flame sprang forth, pale and bluish at first, fed by the alcohol vapors saturating the old parchments, then morphing into an orange tongue, hungry and roaring. Elias released the Codex onto the high altar's carpet as soon as the heat threatened to blister his fingertips. The parchment, hide cured ages past, writhed under the fire's fury, releasing a biting stench that instantly blended with the cathedral's stale incense.

"Sacrilege!" The cry erupted not from Monsignor Camiña, but from the Pilgrim's throat.

Silas, until then a granite effigy, a threat held captive in stone, splintered. He cared nothing for his own person; for him, those words penned in iron gall ink were more hallowed than the flesh he wore. He flew at the embers with the desperation of a mother watching her child's crib burn.

Elias didn't pause to verify if the assassin would achieve his goal. The pain in his right leg, a constant, gnawing throb from the crypt's fall, roared at him as he forced his muscles to react. He spun on his heels, despite the vertigo that reeled him, and propelled himself toward the pillar where Sarah was held. Each stride was an exercise in agony, a reminder that his academic's frame wasn't forged for war, but adrenaline served as a brutal, temporary anesthetic.

Smoke billowed up, a thick black column that licked the baroque vaults, veiling the polychrome wooden angels in a pall of soot.

"Stop him! Kill them all!" Camiña bellowed, his voice shedding its ecclesiastical composure to expose the panic of a man watching his dominion crumble.

The prelate cast his gaze toward the upper galleries, searching for the nozzles of the fire suppression system, that complex network of halon gas the Order had funded to safeguard its treasures. The sensors blinked with red strobe lights, painting the nave in intermittent crimson, but the nozzles remained silent. No hissing discharge, no chemical deluge.

Elias discerned the expression of utter terror on the Monsignor's face as he limped. *Sabotage.* The Order had deactivated the defenses to operate in the shadows, and now that very gloom they created turned into their undoing. The fire acknowledged no lord.

The guard holding Sarah made a novice's error: he looked at the light. The blaze in the presbytery snatched his focus for the time it takes a heart to beat twice. It was enough.

Sarah Al-Fayed needed no savior; she merely required a diversion. She felt the grip on her arm loosen imperceptibly. She didn't hesitate. She rotated on her hip, using the inertia of her own weight, and thrust her elbow back with the brutal precision of a spring. The bone slammed into the man's solar plexus with a sickening thud, instantly draining his lungs of air.

The guard doubled over, gasping like a fish stranded on land. Sarah gave him no quarter. Before the man could regain his breath or reach for his weapon, she whirled and brought the sole of her hiking boot down on her attacker's knee. The snap of tearing ligaments was lost beneath the fire's mounting roar, but the man crumpled onto the granite slab floor, incapacitated.

"Elias!" Her voice sliced through the heavy air, clear and commanding.

The paleographer reached her, panting, his chest burning as fiercely as the altar behind them. He clutched the arm she offered, not as a rescuer, but as a shipwrecked sailor grasping for a plank.

"The fire suppression system..." he gasped, pointing upwards with a trembling finger. "It's not working. We're in a stone trap."

A curtain of thick smoke descended from the ceiling, reducing visibility to mere feet. Santiago Cathedral, immense and cavernous, had transformed into a suffocating snare of gloom and disarray. The other guards' figures were hazy specters moving in the toxic haze, coughing, disoriented, with no clear target to shoot.

From the altar, an inhuman roar, guttural and dreadful, reverberated off the stone walls. Silas emerged from the smoke screen.

His long coat smoked, with patches of scorched fabric, and his hands, with which he had tried to beat out the flames bare-skinned, were a mass of reddened flesh and blackish blisters. Still, he clutched the Codex against his chest. The book was damaged, its edges charred, but intact.

Pain held no sway over the albino. His eyes, devoid of brows and lashes, gleamed with fanatical madness in the alarms' red gloom.

"Heretics!" Silas spat. He didn't run towards them; he walked. A heavy, relentless stride, like death itself cleaving a path through hell.

"To the transept!" Sarah cried, yanking Elias.

The main exit, the Pórtico de la Gloria, was sealed by the wall of fire already creeping towards the wooden pews of the central nave, fueled by the drafts the Gothic architecture itself generated. The path to the sacristy, however, was blocked by Camiña and his remaining men, who were starting to regroup, coughing and covering their mouths with their cassock sleeves.

Only one option remained: to delve into the cathedral's cross-arm, towards the Puerta de Platerías or the Puerta de Azabachería. With luck, the grates would be open or the old ironwork would yield.

They ran. Or rather, Sarah ran, dragging Elias, whose halting rhythm struck a clumsy counterpoint on the stone. The smoke pricked their eyes, forcing out tears that bore no relation to weeping. Elias's throat clamped shut at the lungful of thick, searing air.

Reaching the transept's crossing, beneath the immense central dome, they halted abruptly.

The Botafumeiro, that massive, silver-plated brass censer, hung motionless in the gloom above, like a pendulum poised to deliver judgment. But below, the way to the south arm was barred. A wrought-iron gate, typically left open by day, had been lowered. Through the bars, they glimpsed the exit to the Plaza de Platerías, night rain lashing the outer cobblestones, freedom just thirty feet away.

Sarah rattled the gate. Locked.

"Damn it!" she growled, striking the cold metal with her palm.

Behind them, the fire's orange glow intensified, casting Silas's long, distorted shadow across the floor. The assassin drew closer, heedless of the burns on his hands, impervious to the smoke, his tactical knife gleaming in his right hand. He had already tucked the book into an inner pocket of his ruined coat.

They were cornered in the transept. On one side, the unyielding gate. On the other, the fire and Camiña's men. And ahead, tightening the cordon, the monster who felt no pain.

Elias sagged against a column, his lungs clawing for air. He wiped his glasses with an automatic, futile gesture, for soot instantly smeared them again.

"Sarah," he rasped, his voice hoarse with smoke. "There's no physical exit."

She turned, her dark eyes gleaming with fury and calculation, searching for a weakness in the structure, a weapon, anything. But there was only stone, smoke, and an enemy advancing with the relentless march of a true nightmare.

## Chapter 29: Ascenso a los Cielos

CHAPTER: 29 - Ascent to the Heavens

The heat climbed the stone spiral like a syringe's plunger, pushing them upward, ever upward. Elias Varela felt the spiral staircase closing in on his shoulders, a granite gut digesting the smoke from the fire below only to spew it out into the night.

"Move your feet, Elias!" Sarah Al-Fayed's cry bounced off the curved walls, warped by the tubular acoustics.

Elias didn't answer. He had no breath left for words, barely enough for the basic mechanics of survival. His right leg no longer sent signals of sharp agony; it had transformed into a kind of electric stiffness, a dead wood he had to drag step after agonizing step. His makeshift staff struck the stone with a syncopated rhythm: *clack, drag, gasp*—a metric of desperation.

Each turn of the helix seemed identical to the last, a geometric nightmare without end. Sweat stung his eyes, mingling with the greasy soot that hung in the air. His glasses, grimy and fogged, slid down the bridge of his nose, but he dared not release the frayed rope handrail to adjust them. If he fell now, he would block Sarah's path, or worse, tumble into whatever came behind him.

Because something was coming.

These were no hurried footsteps. There was none of the chaotic frenzy of a standard chase. What echoed below, seeping through the blind arrow slits, was a methodical cadence. A predatory rise.

"I see the lintel," Sarah declared, her voice taut from the exertion of pulling him.

A current of glacial air, utterly alien to the inferno of the central nave, streamed down the stairwell. It collided with the rising warm air, conjuring eddies of ash that danced in the gloom.

Sarah slammed into the oak door at the top of the landing. The wood, swollen by centuries of Galician damp, wailed with a moan of rusty hinges before giving way.

The world shifted instantly.

They staggered out onto the Cruz dos Farrapos. The pressure change was brutal. They left behind the fire's crimson suffocation, greeted by the Atlantic's gray wrath. The wind howled between the towers, a sharp lament that erased all human sound. The rain didn't fall; it struck horizontally, thousands of liquid needles piercing exposed skin.

Elias slipped the moment his boot met the outer granite. The ground wasn't level. They stood on the cathedral's stepped roofs, a topography of slanting slabs meant to shed water, not to accommodate men.

"Watch out!" Sarah snatched his tweed jacket lapel, halting his slide towards the gargoyles spewing water into the void.

The paleographer wedged his staff into a crack between two ashlar blocks and scanned his surroundings, trying to get his bearings through the wet lenses. They stood at the crossroads of the roofs, beneath the Clock Tower's immense shadow. The place was a sacrificial pyramid built from the earth's hardest stone, gleaming black beneath the storm. Below, in Quintana Square, the city lights were blurred smudges, distant and unconcerned, separated from them by thirty meters of sheer drop.

"We have to reach the Obradoiro facade," Sarah yelled, pointing west, where the two main towers pierced the low clouds. "If they see us from the square, the police—"

"The granite... it's ice," Elias cautioned, his voice a whisper the wind nearly swallowed. He tested his bad leg's purchase on the sloping surface. The joint groaned in protest, threatening to give way under the shift in angle. There was no traction. Millennia-old moss, reawakened by the rain, transformed each slab into an oil slick.

A metallic clang behind them, dry and conclusive, cleaved the storm's roar.

The door they'd exited slammed shut.

Elias and Sarah turned as one. The silhouette stood stark against the meager light that flowed from the stairwell before completely eclipsing it. The Pilgrim stood there.

Silas seemed impervious to the elements. His long coat, waterlogged and heavy, didn't billow in the wind; it hung from him like lead armor. Rain streamed over his shaved skull without him blinking. The truly frightening thing wasn't the curved knife he gripped in his right hand, nor the square bulk beneath his clothes where he kept the stolen Codex.

It was his stance.

While Elias clawed at the granite and Sarah bent her knees, seeking purchase, Silas stood rooted to the slick stone with an unnatural stability. His feet didn't search for support; they knew precisely where to be. He knew every unevenness, every loose slab, every drainage channel.

"There is no escape, Doctor Varela," Silas's voice cut through the curtain of water, clear and projected with the technique of a choir singer. "This place was fashioned to bring men closer to God. Or to send them to Him."

Elias grasped the scope of their disadvantage then. They weren't merely fleeing a killer on a rooftop. They had trespassed into the Order's domain. For centuries, men like Silas had patrolled these heights, clearing gutters, mending tiles, and watching the city from the shadows of the balustrades.

The assassin stepped forward. He didn't walk; he flowed across the treacherous stone.

"Run," Sarah urged, shoving Elias towards the narrow walkway skirting the central nave. "Head for the tower!"

"I can't run!" he retorted, frustration fracturing his voice as his useless leg slid vital inches toward the abyss.

"Then crawl!"

Sarah inserted herself between the paleographer and the executioner. She wrenched a loose granite tile free, heavy and crude, weighing it in her hand like a prehistoric weapon.

Silas cocked his head, a gesture of almost avian curiosity.

"The woman who defends the scribe," he murmured, taking another step onto the lethal incline without even glancing at his feet. "An inversion of the natural order."

Elias, propelling himself with his staff and bare hands, began a humiliating climb up the sloping slabs of the gabled roof. The stone abraded his palms, the cold numbed his ink-stained fingers. He glanced back once.

Silas didn't rush Sarah. He waited for the precise instant a gust of wind unbalanced the historian, then struck. It was an economical, savage motion. The blade glinted with the flash of a distant lightning strike. Sarah ducked the neck-slash by a hair's breadth, sliding intentionally to gain space, but the rooftop offered no quarter. Her controlled fall devolved into a perilous slide towards the transept's edge.

"Sarah!" Elias cried.

"Keep going!" she bellowed, digging her boots into a gargoyle to halt her descent right at the precipice.

Silas disregarded the woman for a moment. His icy gaze fixed on Elias, who wrestled with gravity and the very architecture itself. The killer began his ascent after him. He didn't use his hands. He scaled the roof's stone steps with the effortless grace of one approaching a high altar, closing the distance with each assured stride.

Elias reached the rooftop's crest. The wind up there was a physical force, an invisible wall striving to topple him. To his left, the sheer drop to Plaza de la Inmaculada; to his right, the abyss of Quintana. He was upon the stone beast's spine, laid bare to the heavens, with a predator ignorant of vertigo drawing ever closer.

He looked ahead. The Caraca Tower loomed fifty meters away, an unattainable sanctuary across a slippery stone bridge barely a meter wide.

Silas was ten paces away. Nine.

Elias gripped his staff's handle until his knuckles blanched white. Academic logic, books, theory... none of it mattered up here. Only the physics of bodies in motion and the law of gravity remained.

## Chapter 30: La Cruz dos Farrapos

CHAPTER: 30 - The Cross of Tatters

The downpour had transcended a mere atmospheric condition, transforming into a biblical scourge. The water did not fall in drops, but in dense, icy sheets that lashed the granite with the force of flung gravel, rendering the cathedral's rooftops a lethal skating rink. Visibility shrank to a scant few yards; beyond that, the world dissolved into liquid darkness, broken only by the sporadic, brutal flash of lightning that carved the towers against the void.

Elías Varela drew back, dragging his injured leg. The limb no longer conveyed recognizable sensations; it had become a deadweight of petrified wood and charred nerves, an inert mass threatening to anchor him to oblivion. Each backward step sent an electric jolt from his ankle to the base of his skull, clouding his vision more effectively than the deluge itself.

Before him, etched against the faint light streaming from the skylight of the Cross of Tatters, the Pilgrim advanced. Silas did not run. There was no need. He moved with the eerie fluidity of one who has walked precipices all his life, his boots finding purchase where only moss and slick stone lay. His long coat, soaked and heavy, seemed no impediment; rather, it lent him the silhouette of a raptor folding its wings before the final strike.

"The story ends here, scribe," Silas's voice barely cut through the wind's howl, a monotonous, metallic growl.

In his right hand, the tactical blade glinted under a lightning flash, an extension of surgical steel promising a swift end. His left hand pressed the bulk of the Codex to his chest, shielded beneath layers of technical fabric, as though it were a second heart.

Sarah Al-Fayed erupted from the flanking darkness like a vengeful wraith. No war cry escaped her, only the ragged breath of one summoning her last reserves of glycogen. She flung herself against the assassin's side, aiming to unbalance him with the sheer force of her body, her shoulder a battering ram.

The move was courageous, born of desperation, yet it lacked the Pilgrim's chilling precision. Silas pivoted on his heel with an unnerving economy of motion. He did not block the impact; he redirected it. His armed arm arced short and savage.

A wet sound rose, fabric and flesh parting in one awful instant.

Sarah gasped, a choked, dry sound, and reeled toward the balustrade. Her hand flew to her right thigh, where blood began to mingle with the rainwater, dark and thick. She dropped to one knee, sliding on the polished granite, her structural defense shattered.

"Amateurs," Silas spat, not deigning to glance at the fallen woman. His attention swung back to Elías, his true target, the heretic who dared profane the sacred.

Elías felt panic try to seize his throat, clamping his windpipe with unseen fingers. He groped in his mind for some quotation, some Latin passage to lend him courage, but found only the blank void of terror. His trembling right hand clutched the splintered remnant of his staff as if it were a sword, a pathetic gesture against the lethal efficiency of the man before him.

He took another step back, and his heel struck metal.

Elías cast his gaze downward for an instant. He was hemmed in against the restoration scaffolding surrounding the base of the Cross of Tatters' chimney. The tubular steel structure thrummed with the wind. At his feet, the rooftop floor shifted: ancient flagstones yielded to a section raised by modern masons, marked with red chalk that the rain strove to efface.

His paleographer's brain, trained to discern the slightest inconsistency in ink or parchment, processed his surroundings with abrupt, stark clarity. He saw no weapons. He saw structural pathologies.

He noted the *schistosity* — the exfoliation — of the flagstones where Silas was poised to step. He marked the dark, viscous stain coating the stone: *Verdín*. A biological blend of cyanobacteria and fungi that, when wet, gained a friction coefficient akin to ice. And he saw something more: an oak wedge, temporarily placed by the restorers beneath an unstable perimeter slab, swollen with dampness.

Silas took a step. The gap closed.

"Nowhere left to go, Elías. Hand over the truth."

The assassin stood two meters away. Elías knew he couldn't strike Silas. It would be like punching a concrete wall. But the paleographer didn't need to break the man; he merely needed to reframe the context.

Elías dropped, not from the agony in his leg, but in a calculated genuflection. He released the staff and his hands clamped around the heavy leather pouch of his restoration kit, slung from his shoulder.

"The truth..." Elías whispered, his voice splintered with effort as he twisted his torso, "...is that even stone grows weary."

With a cry that tore his lungs, Elías did not hurl the pouch at Silas. He flung it with every ounce of inertial force against the wooden wedge supporting the perimeter slab, just to the right of the assassin's braced foot.

The impact was a dull thud, wood against saturated wood.

The wedge sprang free.

Physics rendered its verdict.

The granite slab, weighing nearly a hundred kilos, robbed of its fulcrum and lubricated by verdín and the sheeting water, canted violently like an ancient temple trap. The ground beneath Silas's left boot ceased to be certain, transforming into a forty-five-degree incline.

Silas's ice-blue eyes widened, revealing for the first time a human emotion: disbelief.

His leg shot out into the void. The assassin tried to compensate, arms flailing for balance, but inertia had already claimed victory. His right hand, blade clutched within it, groped frantically for purchase, yet found only air and rain. His left hand, however, made the fatal error: it clamped even tighter around the Codex beneath his coat.

That added weight, those mere five hundred grams of parchment and leather, shifted his center of gravity those defining millimeters toward the chasm.

Elías saw the precise instant gravity claimed its tithe. Silas did not cry out. His discipline held absolute, even to the last. He simply vanished from view, swallowed by the darkness beyond the parapet.

A terrible silence descended, broken only by the wind's roar, which seemed to hold its breath for three interminable seconds.

Then, a sickening sound drifted up from the courtyard below, seventy meters down. It wasn't a dry thud, but the intricate, conclusive noise of something organic unmaking itself against the unyielding stone of the Plaza de la Inmaculada. A wet, final sound that no history book could ever chronicle.

Elías remained frozen, kneeling in the water, his chest heaving with painful spasms. The rain cleansed the mud from his hands, yet not the sensation of having committed an irreversible act. He adjusted his spectacles, a purely mechanical gesture, futile beneath the downpour, his fingers slipping on the wet frame.

Sarah crawled towards him, leaving a coppery trail that the water instantly diluted. Her face was pallid, lips blue from cold and blood loss, but her dark eyes blazed with a feverish intensity.

"The book?" she asked, her voice a mere raspy thread.

Elías gazed toward the chasm's edge, where darkness had swallowed both executioner and salvation.

"Down," he replied, the word tasting of ash and iron. "Everything's down."

The wind shifted, striking them head-on, carrying the scent of ozone and, faintly, the metallic tang of death rising from the hallowed ground. They were alive, yet victory bore the bitter taste of catastrophe. The Codex, the key to everything, lay shattered beside the corpse of one who swore to protect it by its destruction.

Elías tried to rise, but his leg failed him spectacularly, sending him sprawling back onto the soaked granite. This time, he made no effort to stand. He stayed there, beneath the storm's relentless judgment, understanding that Silas's fall was not the end, but the beginning of a far longer descent for them both.

## Chapter 31: El Último Sermón

CHAPTER: 31 - The Last Sermon

The cloudburst had transformed the atmosphere above Compostela into a thick, near-solid fluid that blurred the world's edges. It wasn't mere rain; it was a liquid shroud of iron, isolating the Cathedral's rooftops from civilization, smothering the city lights beneath a pall of hazy gloom.

Elías Varela dragged his feet across the sloping granite slabs of the Cruz dos Farrapos. His injured leg had ceased sending warnings; it was now a dead weight, a cement block bound to his hip, grinding with each step as if bone had crumbled to gravel inside his flesh.

Beside him, Sarah Al-Fayed leaned against a weathered gargoyle, her breath coming in ragged gasps. Her hand clamped her side, and though the rain scrubbed away any visible blood, the pallor of her face beneath the flickering lightning spoke of a physical threshold breached hours before.

“We can’t descend the north tower,” she gasped, her voice a mere whisper against the wind’s shriek. “The spiral staircase... impossible for me now.”

Elías nodded, adjusting the sodden leather satchel holding the Codex, snatched from Silas’s corpse. The book’s weight felt indecent, a physical burden far too heavy for a mere handful of parchments.

“The cupola’s maintenance entry,” he offered, gesturing toward the central structure. “If we can force that door...”

A silhouette detached itself from the shadow of the Clock Tower, La Berenguela.

No footsteps sounded. The figure simply coalesced from the architecture, as though one of the biblical king statues had chosen to step from its plinth. The black cassock, soaked and heavy, plastered itself to the man’s frame, and his white clerical collar gleamed with an unearthly glow in the fading light.

Monsignor Camiña wasn’t running. He advanced with the measured patience of a man who owned time itself.

Elías froze. The instinct to flee surged through his mind, yet his body stayed rooted. They were caught on the roof’s spine, the precipice of Quintana Square yawning on one side, the plummet to Platerías on the other.

“Monsignor,” Elías said. His own voice sounded alien, ringing with a metallic edge.

Camiña halted five yards distant. He carried no umbrella. Water streamed down his austere face, a visage seemingly carved from the same stone as the temple he oversaw. In his right hand, clasped against his thigh, he held a black pistol—a modern, unsightly thing that shattered the scene's Gothic symmetry.

“Elías.” The tone was soft, almost fatherly, identical to the one he’d employed during Thursday afternoon tutorials a decade past. “I fear you’ve overstepped.”

Sarah tried to rise, but a wrenching spasm folded her back down. Camiña didn't spare her a glance; his gaze remained riveted on his erstwhile pupil.

“I have the book,” Elías slowly unslung the satchel, lifting his hands to show he posed no threat. The motion made his shoulder ache, but he disregarded the sharp twinge. “It’s what you wanted, isn’t it? The true tomb’s location. The Priscillianists’ secret. Take it. Let us leave.”

He tossed the bag. The leather struck the slick stone and skittered to a halt at the priest’s feet.

Camiña cast his gaze down at the item but made no gesture to retrieve it. A sorrowful smile, imbued with boundless melancholy, curved his lips.

“Do you still think this is about paper and ink?” the Monsignor asked, kicking the bag with contempt. The Codex slid a few inches closer to the roof’s edge. “That book is a dangerous artifact, yes. But it’s already irrelevant.”

Elías felt a hollow ache in his gut, colder than the rain.

“Irrelevant? You sent a killer to slay for it. Silas died for that.”

“Silas died because he was a dull instrument. Useful, yet expendable.” Camiña slowly brought the gun up, aiming at Elías’s chest. “I don’t need the Codex, my son. What I need is quiet. History isn’t what occurred; it’s what’s inscribed later. And to compose the correct account, I must expunge the witnesses to the heretical one.”

The realization hit Elías with the stark certainty of mathematics. Camiña wasn’t a treasure hunter; he was a censor. The final censor.

“You know,” Elías breathed, the rain tasting of iron and static in his mouth. “You know what rests in that tomb.”

Camiña cocked the pistol. The metallic snap cut crisply through the storm’s din.

“I know it to be the cornerstone of our faith.”

“It’s not a cornerstone,” Elías countered, taking a step forward. Logic, his old ally, rushed to his aid, pushing aside his fear. “It’s uraninite. Or perhaps enriched pitchblende. A meteorite, yes, but not divine.”

Camiña’s expression flickered for a fraction of a second. The gun barrel held steady, but his eyes narrowed.

“What are you speaking of?”

“I read the marginal notes from the Beato de Liébana you concealed in the archives, Monsignor.” Elías spoke swiftly, words tumbling out, using truth as a bulwark. “The monks who guarded the original tomb in the ninth century... they all perished alike. Sores that wouldn’t close. Teeth and hair falling out. Vomiting blood.”

Sarah lifted her head, comprehension dawning on her face.

“Radiation,” she breathed.

“The ‘Invisible Fire’,” Elías pressed on, raising his voice to pierce the wind’s howl. “You don’t safeguard a miracle. You guard a radioactive isotope fallen from the heavens. The *Malignitas* the Codex mentions isn’t demonic; it’s corporeal. It’s stellar venom.”

A lightning flash illumined Camiña’s face. He resembled an unearthed corpse, pale and gaunt. For the first time, Elías saw the blemishes on the priest’s hands, the very same lesions he’d observed in medieval etchings.

Camiña knew. And he was unwell.

“Suffering purifies,” the priest intoned, his voice now a rasping whisper, shorn of its benevolent veneer. “God tests us with his presence. His light consumes the unworthy.”

“That’s not light!” Elías roared, academic rage scorching his throat. “It’s nuclear physics! You’re murdering your own brethren for a toxic rock! If you rewrite history, if you bury this truth, you will doom generations of innocents to venerate an unshielded nuclear reactor!”

“It is a mystery not for you to bare.”

Camiña’s finger tightened on the trigger. No hesitation marked his posture. Blind faith had consumed the rational man he once was. He would fire. He would sacrifice his Isaac upon the granite altar.

Elías gazed into the barrel’s black maw. His life did not flash before his eyes. He saw only the irony of perishing on the very roof he had pored over in books, slain by the man who taught him how to read them.

“Go on,” Elías dared, holding the old man’s grey stare. “Make me a martyr. But remember this: bones tell stories that paper cannot bury.”

Camiña closed his eyes for a breath, a silent prayer before the execution.

“*In nomine Patris...*”

A flicker of motion, apart from the rain and wind, caught Elías’s peripheral sight.

High on the cupola, some thirty feet above their heads, one of the lantern’s narrow windows stood ajar. No light shone within, but the blackness etched a human form. A compact, practiced silhouette, utterly alien to ecclesiastical architecture.

Elías recognized the outline of a long arm resting on the stone sill.

“Monsignor,” Elías said, his voice falling to an urgent, almost pitying register, “look up.”

Camiña opened his eyes, perplexed by the shift in tone. He did not glance skyward. His hubris forbade him from believing anyone else would trespass on his domain.

“Do not draw out the inevitable, Elías.”

“I’m not doing it for myself. I’m doing it for you. Don’t end this as a butcher.”

Then, a crimson dot, minuscule and pulsating like a luminous insect, settled upon Camiña’s soaked cassock, directly above his heart.

The priest cast his eyes down, mesmerized by the tiny laser gleam capering on the black cloth. His armed hand began to quiver.

From the cupola’s high window, an amplified voice, warped by the wind yet unmistakably commanding, shattered the sermon.

“*Policía Nacional. Drop the weapon. Now.*”

It was Valdés. The inspector had ascended. “Divine intervention” wore a ballistic vest.

Camiña glanced toward the window, then at Elías, and at last to the square’s chasm behind him. Understanding bloomed across his face: his narrative had been cut short. Absolute control had fractured.

Elías held his breath. The question hung in the ozone-charged air: would the zealot yield, or would he complete his final bloody rite?

Camiña raised the gun toward Elías once more, a martyr’s smile gracing his ailing face.

“History is written by the victors, Elías. But legend... legend belongs to the dead.”

## Chapter 32: La Caída del Ídolo

{
  "translated_text": "CAPÍTULO: 32 - The Idol's Fall\n\nThe rain, far from cleansing the scene, seemed determined to erase it, dissolving rock and flesh into a single, grey smudged indistinction. Elías Varela watched, through the watery film that slicked his lenses, as the world's strain snapped, not with a clap of thunder, but a silent implosion.\n\nInspector Valdés didn't shout. No dramatic orders were issued. He simply moved forward, a compact, efficient shadow silhouetted against the gloomy Galician sky. His boot struck Monsignor Camiña's wrist with a blunt force, dislodging the Walther pistol, which slid across the granite tiles to settle in the gutter. The prelate offered no resistance; his body, encased in the liturgical vestments that now seemed a heavy, ludicrous pall, collapsed onto the deck.\n\nElías felt gravity double its grip. The adrenaline, the chemical surge that had sustained him for the last hour, now ebbed away, abandoning him on the shores of his physical exhaustion. He tried to step toward the inspector, but his right leg refused to comply. It wasn't an acute ache, but a sudden loss of bearing, as if his femur had crumbled to powdered glass, incapable of bearing any strain. He gripped the stone gargoyle to stay upright, feeling a deep, localized heat in his thigh, a fire utterly divorced from the night's glacial bite.\n\n\"Secured,\" Valdés said flatly, holstering his weapon. The crisp click of the safety engaging marked the definitive end of the violence.\n\nThe inspector knelt beside Camiña. Elías, dragging the dead weight of his injured limb, pulled himself closer. He needed to see. He needed to confirm that the man who had haunted his academic and physical nightmares no longer posed a threat.\n\nThe Monsignor's face was turned heavenward, receiving the deluge with open eyes. A cerulean cast blanched his skin, contrasting sharply with the cardinal purple of his drenched stole. His chest moved with irregular spasms, the death rattle of machinery starved of fuel.\n\nValdés pressed two fingers against the old man's neck, seeking a fading pulse.\n\nCamiña's lips, blue from hypoxia and cold, trembled. Elías leaned in, ignoring the vertigo that threatened to send him sprawling. He expected a final curse, a Latin quotation damning his soul or justifying the slaughter.\n\n\"Stella...\" the prelate whispered.\n\nThe word emerged wreathed in a froth of blood and spittle. It was no war cry, but a plea, or perhaps a final acknowledgment. The old man's eyes lost their focus, losing the fanatical gleam that had so characterized them, becoming as inert and empty as the statues adorning the Obradoiro facade.\n\nValdés withdrew his hand and looked at Elías. He shook his head once.\n\nElías stared at the corpse. He should have felt relief, or perhaps that vindictive euphoria cheap novels depicted. Instead, he felt a cavernous void in his stomach. There lay one of the Church's most brilliant minds, a living archive of forbidden knowledge, reduced to mere organic matter, cooling in the rain. The \"idol\" had fallen, but in doing so, it had made clear that history is not written by the victors, but by the survivors, and the cost of survival was this bleak melancholy.\n\nA burst of blue light shattered the gothic atmosphere.\n\nThe wail of a siren, distorted by the wind, heralded the intrusion of the modern world into that medieval sanctuary. The access point to the rooftops lit up with tactical flashlight beams and the jarring yellow of emergency uniforms.\n\n\"Here!\" Valdés shouted, waving his flashlight towards the tower door. \"We need immediate stabilization!\"\n\nElías spun on his heels, a movement that sent an electric jolt from his knee to his hip, forcing him to bite his lip to stifle a cry. But the pain was irrelevant. His mind, which had been fixed on the enemy, swung violently toward the one variable that truly mattered.\n\nSarah.\n\nShe was lying on the flagstones, where he had shielded her with his own body minutes before. She seemed tiny in the immensity of the cathedral, a dark form barely distinguishable from the shadows.\n\nParamedics arrived like an invasion of efficient locusts, laden with orange cases and speaking in rapid, clipped medical jargon that layered over the storm's roar. Elías found himself gently nudged aside by a paramedic.\n\n\"Sir, I need you to stand back. Let us work.\"\n\nElías wanted to protest, to explain that he was the only one who truly understood the underlying architecture of the events, but his voice caught in his throat. He felt helpless, a bystander in his own tragedy. He watched them cut away Sarah's jacket fabric, watched them insert IV lines with choreographed precision.\n\nHe slumped onto a stone ledge, unable to remain upright for another second. He removed his spectacles, not to clean them, but because he no longer wished to see the details. The blurred world was more tolerable: fast-moving smudges of color, strobe lights dancing off the water.\n\n\"Elías.\"\n\nThe voice was a barely audible thread, hoarse and weak, yet it sliced through the auditory chaos with surgical precision.\n\nElías fumbled his spectacles back on. Sarah’s eyes searched for him. She wore an oxygen mask over her face, which fogged with each rhythmic exhalation. Despite the deathly pallor of her olive skin and the blood smearing her forehead, her black eyes retained that fierce intensity, that fire that would not be extinguished.\n\nHe crawled to her side, ignoring the paramedics' reproving glances.\n\nSarah raised her left hand. The movement was slow, trembling, fighting against gravity and shock. Her fingers, stained with soot and centuries of dust, reached into the void.\n\nElías didn't hesitate. He enveloped her hand with his own.\n\nThe contact was an anchor. Sarah's skin was cold, damp, yet her grip was firm. There were no romantic words, no promises of a future. Only the brutal, tactile confirmation that they were still there. That the abyss had stared at them, and for once, had blinked first.\n\nElías clutched her fingers, feeling the calluses on his own hand graze against the historian's soft wrist, just above the astrolabe tattoo. In that silent gesture, beneath the incessant rain over Compostela, he understood that the codex, the meteor, and the heresy were secondary.\n\nThe single absolute truth that held any weight in that moment was the faint warmth of that hand in his.",

## Chapter 33: Cenizas y Silencios

CAPÍTULO: 33 - Ashes and Silences

The sterile hum of fluorescent tubes had supplanted the storm's roar. No scent of stale incense or damp stone lingered, only industrial disinfectant and the boiled meals trundling along the corridor.

Elías Varela studied the ceiling cracks in Room 402 of the Clinical Hospital. His right leg, now encased in a rigid plaster cast reaching to his knee, felt alien, a leaden anchor moored in the starched sheets. The agonizing bite that had plagued him in the tower had morphed into a relentless pressure, a geological weight that brought home his biological frailty whenever he shifted.

He turned his head to the adjacent bed. Sarah Al-Fayed dozed, or feigned it. Her left arm rested in a sling, a square dressing plastered to her cheekbone, concealing the gash the masonry had bestowed upon her from the cornice. Even at rest, her body held a defensive tautness, like a coiled spring poised to leap at the slightest sound.

The door swung open without warning, yet without force.

Inspector Valdés entered, trailing the scent of cold tobacco and recent rain. He wore no tactical uniform, soaked two nights prior, but a gray trench coat that made him appear broader, wearier. He dragged a tangerine plastic visitor's chair and positioned it in the neutral zone separating the beds.

Sarah's eyes snapped open. Her pupils, black and keenly alert, betrayed no surprise, only calculation.

“Inspector,” she greeted, her voice raspy.

“Doctors.” Valdés sank into the chair, exhaling a sigh that seemed to drain his lungs. “I trust the room service meets your approval. They say the cafeteria's Galician broth can raise the dead, though in my experience, it only keeps them lukewarm.”

Elías fumbled for his glasses on the nightstand. His fingers brushed the cold metal before he settled them on his face, restoring sharp edges to the world.

“I assume you haven't come to discuss hospital cuisine,” the paleographer murmured.

Valdés produced a slender file from inside his trench coat and rested it on his knees. He did not open it. He drummed his fingers on the cardboard surface.

“The Archbishopric issued a statement an hour ago.” The detective's gaze settled on the window, where raindrops blurred Santiago’s lights. “Monsignor Camiña suffered an acute psychotic episode brought on by the pressures of his office. Apparently, he had been concealing a progressive dementia for months.”

“Dementia?” Sarah pushed herself up slightly, wincing as her ribs complained. “He was a lucid fanatic, Inspector. He knew exactly what he was doing.”

“To the world, he was an ailing old man who, in his delirium, caused an accidental fire in the roof structures while attempting an unauthorized repair on the electrical system.” Valdés rattled off the story with the flat cadence of someone reading a grocery list. “A tragic end. He tumbled from the Carraca Tower, gripped by panic.”

Elías tasted metal in his mouth. The narrative was flawless. Pristine. It absolved the Church of harboring an assassin sect within its fold and transformed an executioner into a victim of senility.

“And us?” Elías inquired, pinning the detective with his gray gaze. “What is our part in this fabrication?”

“You two are valiant academics who, perceiving smoke from the plaza, scaled the tower to aid the poor Monsignor. Sadly, you arrived too late to save him, but managed to survive the partial structural collapse. Civic heroes.” Valdés at last met their eyes. A stark warning gleamed in his expression. “The matter is closed, doctors. No assassins, no ancient conspiracies, and certainly no apocryphal gospel.”

“The Codex,” Sarah cut in, her jaw tight. “What does the report say about the book?”

Valdés gestured vaguely towards the outside.

“Ashes. Firefighters discovered remnants of charred parchment near the body. An irreparable loss to historical heritage, no question, but fire cleanses many things. Including evidence that could make life difficult for people who merely wish to return to their libraries.”

The message was transparent. They could accept the lie and walk free, or speak the truth and confront a system that would crush them before they could utter “Prisciliano.”

Silence stretched in the room, thick and heavy. Elías felt blood pound in his temples. It was the easy way out. The craven way out. The sole logical course.

“We understand,” Elías said, leaning back against his pillow. The plaster's stiffness prevented him from crossing his legs, a comfort his body craved.

Valdés nodded once, slow and solemn. He rose, his knees creaking.

“Glad to hear it. Your medical discharge is set for tomorrow morning. I suggest you take a holiday. Far from churches.”

The inspector walked towards the door but paused, hand on the knob. He did not turn.

“By the way, Varela. My agents recovered your personal effects from the tower. They’re in that bag in the wardrobe. I checked the inventory. Everything appears accounted for: wallet, keys, a Zippo lighter devoid of fuel... and a good deal of paper rubbish in the pockets. No one bothers to read a wounded man's trash. It's bad form.”

Without awaiting a reply, Valdés exited, and the door clicked shut with an air of finality.

Sarah waited a full ten seconds before speaking.

“It's over,” she said, letting her head fall back. Her voice sounded hollow, stripped of the adrenaline that had fueled her for days. “Camiña won. He carried the secret to his grave, and we are left with the scars and a fabricated tale.”

Elías did not reply at once. His attention fixed on the metal wardrobe recessed into the wall.

“Sarah, would you hand me that plastic bag there? My mobility is... curtailed.”

The historian regarded him with a frown, puzzled by the shift in topic, but complied. She slid gingerly from the bed, shuffling her bare feet across the cool linoleum, and tossed the white bag bearing the hospital's emblem onto his lap.

“Looking for your phone? I doubt we have reception to call the press, Elías. We just agreed to silence.”

Elías disregarded the remark. He opened the bag with hands that trembled faintly, not from fear, but from the electric thrill he felt only before a breakthrough. He pushed aside the waterlogged leather wallet and the dented Zippo. He rummaged in the bottom, where his tattered tweed jacket lay, its sleeve ripped and smudged with soot.

He plunged his hand into the inner pocket, feeling through the damp wool.

“Valdés is right about one thing,” Elías said, his voice dropping to that reverent murmur he reserved for reading rooms. “No one checks trash if it looks like trash.”

His fingers closed around something that was neither a used handkerchief nor a cafeteria receipt. He extracted a sheet of parchment, folded into quarters. The material felt resilient, animal hide cured nine centuries prior, capable of withstanding dampness and rough handling.

Sarah froze at the foot of the bed. Her dark eyes widened immeasurably.

“No…” she breathed. “You told me you had it in your hand when Camiña attacked you. You said it fell.”

“I said I lost the Codex. And it’s true. The bound volume plummeted into the void.” Elías unfolded the parchment with infinite care, smoothing the creases onto the white sheet. The iron-gall ink gleamed dark and defiant beneath the artificial light. “But in the atrium, before we ascended, when I noticed the binding was loose… I had a moment of professional weakness. Or foresight.”

Sarah drew closer, forgetting the ache in her ribs. She leaned over the document.

It was the final page. The ultimate map.

It wasn't a conventional geographical map. It was a layering of architectural lines and constellations. The drawing depicted a cross-section of a mountain, and beneath it, a chamber carved into living rock. Yet what stood out was the marginal inscription, penned in hasty Latin, distinct from the monastic calligraphy elsewhere in the book.

“*Sub stellae umbra*,” Sarah read, translating on the fly. “Beneath the shadow of the star.”

“Camiña died murmuring ‘Stella,’” Elías recalled. He removed his glasses and polished them with the edge of the sheet, an automatic gesture to buy time and absorb the image. “He wasn’t calling out. He was naming the location.”

Sarah traced with her index finger a sinuous line drawn on the map, linking the Cathedral to a geographical rise to the southeast.

“Pico Sacro,” she identified. Her voice regained its edge, its scholarly authority. “Legend holds that it was there the disciples tamed wild bulls to transport Saint James’s body. But geologically, it’s a system of quartz caves.”

“And according to this,” Elías gestured to a point marked with an inverted black star, “that’s where the heresy concealed whatever they brought from Egypt. Not in the Cathedral. The Cathedral is the decoy, an empty shell for tourists and the faithful. The true *Sanctum* lies in the mountain.”

They exchanged glances. The aura of defeat had vanished, superseded by a dizzying weight. No assassins stalked them now. Camiña was dead. The police had closed the case. No one sought them. No one expected anything from them save that they retreat home to tend their wounds.

They could halt. They could incinerate that page in the washroom and revert to lives of dull lectures and academic papers no one read.

Sarah braced her hands on the rail of Elías’s bed. A slow, perilous, brilliant smile spread across her weary face.

“I’m discharged tomorrow at nine,” she said.

Elías put his glasses back on. The map’s sharp clarity before his eyes was the only tonic he required. He felt the dead weight of his leg, but it no longer felt like an anchor; rather, an acceptable cost.

“My car’s still parked near the faculty building,” he replied. “It’s an automatic. I can drive with my left.”

Sarah nodded, taking the parchment and carefully refolding it to tuck away, this time, into her own pocket.

“Then, Elías, it appears we have an outing ahead of us.”

Outside, the storm relented, yet within Room 402, they had just chosen to walk directly into the hurricane’s eye.

## Chapter 34: La Puerta Tapiada

CAPÍTULO: 34 - The Walled-Up Door

The rain in Compostela that night was not a meteorological phenomenon, but a liquid steel curtain that severed Obradoiro Square from the rest of the world. Sheltered beneath a black umbrella, Elías Varela observed the card reader at the discreet side service entrance, the one leading straight to the cathedral's lower levels. His free hand gripped the wooden cane, a necessary acquisition since his hospital discharge. His right knee sent no signals of acute pain, only a rigid, concrete-like stiffness, a leaden weight that made every step a conscious negotiation with gravity.

Sarah Al-Fayed, her hair tucked away beneath the hood of a technical raincoat, held her UNESCO identification card before the sensor. The plastic, scratched and worn, had seen service in excavations from Petra to Cairo.

“Church bureaucracy advances in centuries, not days,” she murmured, her voice barely audible over the drumming rain on the stone. “To the system, I'm still the external consultant tasked with structural assessment.”

The reader's diode flickered red once. Elías held his breath, feeling the damp seep through the soles of his shoes. If Valdés had lied, if the alarm blared, this whole venture would end in a cell before it even began.

The diode switched to green. A mechanical snick freed the lock.

They pushed the reinforced oak door and slipped inside, leaving the storm's roar behind for the heavy silence, thick with the scent of cold incense, of the sleeping cathedral. Elías shook the water from his tweed coat. The scent within differed from the main nave; it carried the tang of upturned earth, of sea salt, and the slow, ancient breath of a structure that had witnessed empires rise and fall.

“Private security guards patrol the cloister every forty minutes,” Sarah informed him, checking the luminous watch on her wrist. “We have a twenty-minute window to reach the Portico's Crypt.”

They descended the spiral staircase. Elías had to lean his full weight on the wrought-iron railing, lowering his good leg first, then dragging the injured one. The joint creaked, an oxidized hinge resisting every flex, but the adrenaline of the hunt greased his mind for a time. He was no longer the academic paralyzed by fear; curiosity had become a biological imperative.

They reached the foundation level. The Crypt, designed by Master Mateo to support the celestial glory of the portico above, was a forest of squat columns and sturdy arches. Emergency lights steeped the granite in a spectral amber, casting shadows that stretched like accusatory fingers among the pillars.

“Based on the overlaid star map and twelfth-century blueprints,” Elías whispered, adjusting the bridge of his spectacles with his index finger, a gesture he now performed with almost military precision, “the 'Black Star' doesn't denote the main altar. It marks the central support. The base of the trumeau column.”

Sarah moved with feline grace, her hiking boots muffling their tread against the uneven flagstones. She paused before a blind arch in the northern section, an area roped off with “Danger: Restoration” tape, which had been there for months, unseen by tourists and guides alike.

“Here,” she indicated.

The rear wall was not original. While the surrounding ashlar blocks bore the green patina of nine centuries of damp, the center of the arch was clad in newer masonry, mortar that, despite attempts to mimic the Romanesque style, lacked the scars of time. It was a patch. A deliberate concealment.

Sarah pulled a small mallet and a wide-tipped chisel from her pack. There was no time for the finesse of an archaeological brush.

“Watch the corridor,” she commanded, crouching.

Elías turned, giving his back to her work. His nearsighted eyes probed the gloom of the lower ambulatory. The silence was absolute, broken only by the rhythmic, dry, and muffled impact of metal biting stone. *Clack. Clack. Clack.* Each strike reverberated in his chest more than the vault. He pictured the *Pilgrim*, Silas, emerging from the shadows, yet the only motion was dust beginning to dance in the beam of Sarah's flashlight.

“The mortar is porous,” she said, her breath ragged from the exertion. “Whoever sealed this wanted to return. Or was simply in a hurry.”

A crumbling sound heralded success. Elías turned. Sarah had breached the lower section of the partition, creating an opening the size of a human head. Stale air, metallic and throat-drying, billowed from the gap. It bore no scent of death or decay. It smelled of static energy, like the air just before lightning strikes.

Sarah widened the hole enough to insert her arm and flashlight.

“It’s not a passageway,” she declared, her voice tinged with surprise. “It’s a niche. A foundation cist.”

Elías drew closer, forgetting the stiffness in his leg. He knelt beside her, ignoring the protesting jab that shot up his thigh. Sarah illuminated the interior.

There, wedged into the living rock upon which the cathedral stood, was a box. It wasn't wood, which would have long rotted, nor iron, which would have rusted to dust. It was grey, opaque, and heavy.

“Lead,” Elías whispered. The word escaped his lips, imbued with reverence and dread.

“Why lead?” Sarah asked. “Reliquaries are typically silver, gold, or fine wood. Lead is for pipes, for roofs... or for shielding.”

“The Romans used lead caskets for *defixiones*, buried curses,” he theorized, his mind racing through archaeological catalogs. “But this... the form is a perfect cube.”

Sarah inserted both hands and, with a grunt of exertion, hauled the object free. It weighed a ton for its size, about thirty centimeters to a side. Its surface was smooth, devoid of inscriptions, crosses, or sacred symbols. A brutalist anomaly within the sacred art.

Elías ran his fingers over the cold, slick surface of the metal. He sensed a vibration, not physical, but a hum in his fingertips, as if the object possessed its own frequency.

“Wait,” Sarah recoiled sharply, as if the box had burned her. She fumbled in the side pocket of her cargo pants and produced a yellow device, a portable Geiger counter she employed at sites with radon risk.

“What are you doing?” Elías asked, though a part of his brain, the segment linking history with physics, began to construct a horrifying picture.

“The Codex spoke of 'invisible light,' of 'fire that doesn't burn but sickens,'” Sarah said, powering on the device.

She brought the sensor close to the lead box.

The crypt's silence shattered.

*Crrrk. Crrrk-crrrk. Crrrrrrrrrrrk.*

The sound was erratic, aggressive, the crackle of an unseen fire. The digital needle on the display leaped from the green zone to the yellow, grazing the red.

Elías recoiled instinctively, tripping over his cane. He looked at the box with new eyes. He no longer saw a historical artifact. He saw the core of the legend.

“It’s no saint's relic,” he said, his voice trembling with the revelation. “*Lapis Stellarum*. The Star Stone.”

“It’s a meteorite,” Sarah completed, observing the reading with a blend of horror and scientific fascination. “A fragment of extraterrestrial matter with high residual radiation. That's why the lead. They weren't shielding it from theft. They entombed it to keep it from killing pilgrims.”

Elías removed his spectacles, polishing them on his jacket lapel with swift, agitated motions, striving to process the sheer scale of the deception.

“The heresy wasn't theological,” he whispered, donning his spectacles once more to view the world with stinging clarity. “It was physical. They weren't worshipping a decapitated martyr. They venerated what fell from the sky. The star that guided the shepherds... was radioactive.”

The Geiger counter's din filled the space, a modern staccato confirming an ancient truth: science and faith had converged in the cellar of Christendom, and what lay within that box could rewrite history or poison anyone who dared unseal it.

## Chapter 35: El Fin del Camino

The drone from the device in Sarah Al-Fayed's hand wasn't a rhythm; it was a raging static, like rain drumming on a tin roof, yet without the promise of water. It was the sound of invisible particles battering the sensor, a silent herald of death.

Before them, in the ragged recess carved behind the crypt's northern wall, the object lay. No golden ark, no marble ossuary sculpted by angels. It was a lead box: dented, grayish, ugly. Its lid had shifted a fraction, perhaps from the tremors of recent construction, or the careless hand of someone who tried to seal it with shoddy cement.

Elías Varela leaned against the stone jamb. His right leg felt alien, a weighty timber block culminating in a swollen ankle, refusing to bear his weight unaided. The pain had transmuted; no longer sharp, but a dull, geological pressure, as if his very bones sought to fuse with the granite floor.

"The counter's gone mad," Sarah whispered. Her voice lacked the urgency of combat; it now held the clinical inflection of one diagnosing a fatal malady. "Five sieverts an hour from that opening. Stay here ten more minutes, and we'll be retching before we even clear the Cathedral."

Elías disregarded the medical prognosis. He removed his glasses, steamed opaque by the subterranean damp, and narrowed his gaze upon the lead box's fissure. No bleached bones lay within. No relics of an apostle beheaded in Judea.

There was a stone.

Black, porous, with the texture of charred sponge and the visual heft of iron. A stone that belonged neither to Galician geology nor, for that matter, to Earth's.

"An aerolite," Elías breathed. The word emerged with the metallic taste beginning to bloom on his tongue, that tang of ozone and static electricity Chernobyl survivors described. "*Lapis Stellarum*."

Sarah dipped her tactical flashlight, casting its beam onto the floor to avoid direct illumination of the radiation source.

"A meteorite?" she asked, grasping for logic within the absurdity. "This entire cathedral, twelve centuries of pilgrimage, wars, schisms... all for a hunk of radioactive space junk?"

"Not junk to them." Elías settled his spectacles back on his nose. Visual clarity offered no solace for the conceptual vertigo. "It's a sky-fallen stone. To a first-century pagan, this was divinity made corporeal. Proof the gods touched the earth. Prisciliano never found Santiago's tomb; he found the ancient worship site of this stone."

The paleographer stretched out a hand, halting inches from the lead. He sensed the heat radiating, not thermal, but a malevolent thrum that prickled the hairs on his arm.

"The Church layered Santiago's myth atop it to Christianize the place," he went on, weaving his thoughts with feverish speed. "But they could never rid themselves of the stone. It was too sacred, too potent. They entombed it in lead, secreted it beneath the high altar, then buried it here, in the foundations."

Sarah eyed the Geiger counter, its display flickering with scarlet numerals.

"And it kills anyone who gets too close. The 'wrath of God'," she said, grasping the biological mechanics behind the curse legends. "The monks who guarded this must have sickened. Sores, hair loss, unseen death. That's why they sealed it."

Elías nodded slowly. The irony weighed as heavily as the architecture crowning them. Millions of souls trekking thousands of miles westward, tracing the Milky Way, only to kneel before a star-shard that bled poison.

"What do we do?" Sarah cut through the toxic sanctuary's hush. Her usual pragmatism wrestled with the enormity of the discovery. She gripped the mallet tighter, as if it could bludgeon the radiation. "We have proof. If we remove this, or even a fragment, the history of Christianity will be rewritten by morning. The Vatican would have to concede that the heart of its third most important pilgrimage is a pagan idol."

Elías gazed at the star map he still crumpled in his left hand. The paper felt damp, smudged with soot and sweat. He thought of Monsignor Camiña, of the Order, of the blood shed to shield this secret. Then he thought of the pilgrims he'd witnessed that morning in the rain, their feet weeping blood, their eyes alight with irrational hope.

If they unearthed that stone, if they laid bare the empirical, scientific, cold truth... what would remain?

"No," Elías stated. His voice rang with an unfamiliar steadiness, devoid of the tremor that often accompanied his choices. "We're not taking it."

Sarah whirled, her light searing his face. The beam wounded the paleographer's sensitive eyes.

"Elías, this thing has killed people. People die shielding a lie."

"People die for faith, Sarah. And faith isn't dependent on the object." Elías gestured toward the blackness within the box. "If we tell them Santiago isn't here, that it's a carbonaceous chondrite stone, do you imagine they'll stop coming? Or worse, do you believe that will bring them peace?"

He pushed off the wall, compelling his injured leg to bear his weight. The pain anchored him to reality, barring him from drifting into academic abstraction.

"Truth is an acid," he continued. "It dissolves. But history, the force that binds civilizations, craves structure. It hungers for myth. We've sought absolute truth to redeem ourselves, to prove we're cleverer than the departed. But the departed knew something we've forgotten: the journey outstrips the destination."

Sarah eyed the box, then Elías. The tension in her shoulders began to recede. She was an art historian; she comprehended the power of symbols. A shattered symbol often leaves a void filled with something far fouler.

"It's radioactive," she pressed, though with less conviction. It was a technical objection, not a moral one.

"Which is why we'll leave it where it belongs. Interred." Elías drew the folded folio from his inner pocket. The Codex page they'd retrieved, the source of their pursuit, the chart to the treasure. "This no longer belongs to us. It never did."

With a solemn gesture, devoid of liturgy yet steeped in reverence, Elías slid the parchment page into the recess, over the shifted lead lid. The aged paper settled onto the gray metal. An offering of knowledge returned to darkness.

"Help me close it," he requested.

Sarah clipped the Geiger counter to her belt. She moved to the recess. No fresh cement remained, yet the ground teemed with the rubble they'd dislodged. Granite stones, weighty and jagged, lay all around.

"Use the mallet," Elías instructed. "Nudge the lead lid back into place first. Don't touch it with your skin."

Sarah wielded the tool's wooden handle to strike the lid's edge. The yielding metal gave way with a muffled thud, *clonk*, sliding closed over the stellar darkness and the parchment. The static drone in the air seemed to abate, if only psychologically.

Then, working in concerted silence, they began to heap the masonry fragments into the cavity. Sarah hoisted the larger pieces, her muscles flexing beneath her leather jacket, while Elías nestled the smaller ones, sealing the gaps like a mason of history.

Each stone placed marked a relinquishment. A relinquishment of academic renown, a relinquishment of vengeance against the Church, a relinquishment of having the final say.

When the cavity was entirely obscured, a raw stone scar upon the crypt wall, Elías wiped dust from his hands onto his corduroy trousers. He felt lighter, his limp notwithstanding.

"No one will ever know what we did here," Sarah said, sweeping her light across the rough-hewn wall.

"We will," Elías replied. He looked at his companion, noting how weariness had carved hollows beneath her dark eyes, yet also how her stance had softened. There was nothing left to seek. The road's end wasn't a treasure; it was the cessation of obsession. "And that is burden enough."

Elías adjusted his scarf, feeling the crypt's chill seep back into his bones now that the discovery's adrenaline had drained away.

"Let's go, Sarah. The living await us above."

Sarah nodded, offering him her shoulder. Elías took it, shifting some of his weight onto her. Together, they turned, their backs to the West's most closely guarded secret, and began the slow, arduous ascent to the surface, where the rain continued cleansing the pilgrims' sins.

## Chapter 36: Ecos de una Vieja Amistad

CAPÍTULO: 36 - Echoes of an Old Friendship

The Café Casino's large window offered a warped view of Rúa do Vilar, transformed by the rain into an impressionistic blur of grey cobblestones and black umbrellas. Elías Varela watched as a lone droplet snaked its way down the glass, swallowing smaller ones in its descent—a metaphor all too plain for the past month's events.

He adjusted his posture in the bentwood chair. His right knee, though now free of the most cumbersome brace, answered with a dry, sharp ache, like the shriek of a rusty hinge. It wasn't the keen agony of the crypt, but a mechanical rigidity, a muted lament the damp air of Compostela eagerly inflamed. He rested his chestnut cane against the marble table; that length of wood had grown into an extension of his arm, a more loyal companion than most of his academic peers.

The bustle of the place was a balm. The clinking of spoons against porcelain, the hiss of the steam machine, and idle chatter concerning the weather or local politics stitched a quilt of normalcy Elías so desperately craved. No one spoke of subterranean fires, or meteorites, or heresies.

"The coffee here is still the city's finest, though the service has shed some ceremony."

Inspector Valdés's voice reached him before the man himself. The officer sank into the chair facing him, his trench coat still on, the garment exuding that unmistakable tang of damp wool and stale tobacco. He seemed older than when they last met under the emergency lights, yet also lighter, as if he'd cast off an unseen armor.

"Inspector," Elías greeted, fighting the instinct to raise a hand and adjust his spectacles. Instead, he interlaced his fingers on the tabletop. "Or should I say, Commissioner?"

Valdés offered a short, humorless chuckle. He gestured to the waiter, requesting a cortado.

"Don't get ahead of yourself, Professor. Call it a lateral move. 'Institutional Liaison Coordinator.' A splendid office in Madrid, near the Ministry. Air conditioning, plush carpet, and, most tellingly, far from any working precinct where compromising truths might be unearthed."

"The cost of silence," Elías breathed. It wasn't a question.

"The cost of equilibrium," Valdés countered, taking the cup the waiter set before him. "The official report on the Cathedral blaze is a bureaucratic triumph. A short circuit within the temporary lighting for the renovations, exacerbated by the existence of flammable restoration materials. Case closed. No one desires to stir the cinders of a World Heritage Site, Varela. Not when the Church and the State have decided on the story to tell."

Elías nodded. He grasped the machinery of forgetting better than anyone; his life's work revolved around what history chose to recall and what it elected to expunge.

"Then this is farewell?"

"Think of it as a case closed." Valdés reached into the inner pocket of his overcoat. For a flash, the motion drew Elías’s shoulders taut, a conditioned response from weeks of being hunted. But what the officer withdrew was neither a summons nor a warrant for his arrest.

It was a small, unmarked manila envelope, bent at the edges.

"Clearing out my desk, I came across something that had... gone astray," Valdés remarked, sliding the envelope across the cool marble tabletop. "Strictly speaking, this should be in an evidence locker or incinerated. But I reckoned you, a man who values context, would find meaning in it."

Elías accepted the envelope. The paper felt warm. Opening it, he drew out a lone black and white photograph, its edges notched, typical of decades-old developing.

The picture showed the cloister of Santiago University. Two young men sat on a stone bench, books open upon their laps. One gazed at the camera with challenging intensity, an intellectual hauteur that seemed to pierce the very paper; his black hair was slicked back. The other, sporting thick-rimmed spectacles and a tentative smile, appeared to listen with rapt attention.

The air lodged in Elías's throat.

The audacious young man was Camiña. The diffident one was his father.

"They were friends, Varela," Valdés said, his voice lowering an octave, becoming almost private. "Before one chose the purple and the other, oblivion. I came across this in the Monsignor's personal safe, not among the diocesan records. He kept it beside his last will and testament."

Elías traced his thumb over his father's face. All at once, Camiña's obsession with him, the venomous tutelage, the exorbitant demands... everything assumed a fresh dimension. It hadn't been mere cruelty; it had been a warped display of loyalty, or perhaps a form of penance. Camiña had sought to sculpt the son of the man he'd perhaps betrayed or left behind, attempting to forge Elías into the robust version his father never became.

"Thank you," Elías breathed. The word held a heavy resonance, laden with a complicated gratitude.

Valdés downed his coffee in a single swallow, as if it were medicine. He rose, fastening his trench coat.

"Madrid is a clamorous city, Professor. I hope memory proves shorter there than in Galicia." He offered his hand.

Elías braced against his cane to rise, disregarding the protest of his tendons. He clasped the officer's hand. The grip was firm, dry, a mutual acknowledgment between two men who had glimpsed the abyss and elected not to plunge.

"Take care, Valdés. And tread carefully in those offices. Sometimes they're more treacherous than the streets."

"I'll bear that in mind. As for you... try not to pore over anything that isn't on the syllabus."

The officer turned and strode toward the exit. The Casino door swung open, admitting a blust of humid wind and the wet whisper of tires on soaked pavement.

Elías settled back into his seat. Through the pane, he watched Valdés cross the sidewalk. The Galician rain did not merely descend; it engulfed the world. It formed a thick curtain, a greyish veil that softened outlines and drank in all color. He watched as the inspector's form blurred, becoming one more shadow among the stone arcades, until the granite city consumed him entirely.

He studied the photograph once more before tucking it into his pocket, close to his heart. The enigma had been deciphered, the dead interred, and the living, exiled or scarred. Only cold coffee remained, and the firm knowledge that, though history is penned by victors, truth always endures in the margins, waiting to be unearthed.

## Chapter 37: La Tesis Prohibida

The bluish glow of the laptop screen was the sole light source in the living room, etching Sarah’s silhouette against the gloom like a modern cameo. Outside, the Atlantic storm raged relentlessly; water drummed against the pane with the persistence of a thousand bony fingers demanding entry, rendering the lights of Rúa do Vilar into milky, distorted blurs.

Sarah Al-Fayed remained motionless before the desk, her right hand poised stiffly over the mouse. On the monitor, a folder titled "CATHEDRAL PROJECT - FINAL VERSION" flickered, outwardly harmless, yet it held the destructive force of an academic bombshell.

From the sofa, Elías watched her. His injured leg was stretched across the coffee table, propped on a cushion. The limb felt alien, a granite block tethered to his hip, occasionally shooting an electric jolt from his calf to the base of his spine, forcing him to clench his jaw. He hadn't removed his tweed jacket, which smelled of damp and stale smoke, an odor that seemed to have steeped into his very pores over the past month.

Elías adjusted his glasses with an index finger, not to clean them, but to sharpen his focus on the tension in his colleague's shoulders. He could read the rigidity in her trapezius, the way her neck bent forward, as if awaiting a verdict.

“Seven years of work, Sarah,” he said. His voice rasped, frayed by exhaustion. “Paris. The Sorbonne chair. It’s all in there.”

Sarah didn’t turn. Her dark eyes, usually so inquisitive, were riveted on the cursor. She saw the conferences flash by, the articles in indexed journals, the recognition from her peers, the validation she’d pursued since leaving Cairo. Everything that defined her success was contained within those gigabytes.

And then there was the lie. Or rather, the truth the world couldn't stomach.

“If I publish this,” she murmured, her voice stripped of its usual command, sounding fragile, utterly human, “I won't just rewrite art history. I’ll shatter the faith of millions to feed the egos of a handful of academics. The Order would rise again, under a new name, with a different face, seeking what we left in the dark.”

Elías shifted, and the movement roused the dormant beast in his wounded leg. He hissed air through his teeth as muscle stiffness bit into his thigh. When the spasm eased, he spoke softly.

“Are you sure? Once you do this, you’ll be just another historian. No one will ever know you held the Church's fate in your hands.”

Sarah tore her gaze from the monitor, letting it fall on the small Moleskine field notebook beside the keyboard. It was filled with subterranean diagrams, transcriptions of funerary steles, and the precise location of the hidden entrance. With mechanical, almost ritualistic movements, she picked up the notebook.

“History is a palimpsest, remember?” she said, finally turning. The screen's glow cast her in a ghostly light.

She tore out the first sheet. The ripping sound was violent in the apartment’s stillness. Then the second. The third. She piled the fragments into an empty ceramic bowl, one that usually held keys.

“Some mysteries ought to remain so,” she declared.

She pulled a lighter from her cargo pants pocket. The flame sprang to life, yellow and dancing, mirroring in her dark pupils. She brought the fire to the paper. The dry, old cellulose caught at once. Smoke began to rise in a grey column, carrying with it the coordinates, the forbidden names, and the very architecture of heresy.

While real fire consumed the physical evidence, her right hand moved on the desk. A dry click.
*Are you sure you want to permanently delete these items?*
Another click.
The folder vanished. The screen displayed an empty desktop, clean, starkly virgin.

Sarah watched the last flames expire in the bowl, leaving only black, twisted ash. An acrid scent filled the room. She collapsed into the chair, expelling air she seemed to have held for weeks. Her shoulders slumped. The structural tension of her body gave way, leaving her exhausted but oddly weightless.

Elías pushed himself up. The maneuver demanded painful logistics: bearing his weight on his good arm, swiveling his hip without twisting the injured knee, and using the sofa back as a lever. He grunted under his breath, a guttural sound of strain, yet managed to get to his feet. He hobbled to the desk, dragging his right foot with exasperating sluggishness.

He stopped beside her. He didn't touch her. Instead, he permeated her personal space with that quiet, dusty presence, which Sarah now found as essential as oxygen.

“My father used to say the true guardian isn't the one who wields the sword, but the one who knows when to sheath it,” Elías said, gazing at the ashes.

He reached into the inner pocket of his misshapen jacket. His fingers brushed against the worn fabric, seeking the small, cold object he’d kept since they left the Cathedral.

“I have something for you. No academic commendation, I’m afraid.”

Sarah looked up. Elías extended his palm.
There, resting on his pale, ink-stained skin near his middle finger, lay a silver pendant. It was a venera, a scallop shell, but not one of the tourist trinkets sold on Rúa do Franco. This one was ancient, silver darkened by centuries, its edges smoothed by the touch of generations of fingers. It had a real, dense weight.

“I found it in the ossuary, near where… where everything ended,” he explained, steering clear of mentioning Silas or the electricity. “It’s twelfth-century. Compostela silversmith work. It likely belonged to someone who completed the journey and understood that the destination wasn’t the tomb, but the return.”

Sarah took the pendant. The metal was cold at first, but warmed quickly against her skin. She traced the shell’s ridges with her thumb, feeling history etched into the silver.

“Elías…” she began, but her throat seized up.

“For the woman who found the truth and had the courage to forget it,” he cut her off, with a shyness that made him seem ten years younger, despite the grey at his temples.

He took an awkward step toward her, conquering the resistance of his own anatomy. Sarah rose. Their height difference was minimal, yet in that moment, enveloped by the scent of burnt paper and the hum of the vacant computer, they seemed to fit like two masonry blocks designed to bear an arch.

She encircled his hand with her fingers, the one still hovering in the air after offering the gift. Elías’s skin felt dry, rough from the archive dust; hers, weathered by sun and rock.

“I don’t know what I’ll do now,” Sarah admitted, clutching the pendant in her fist. “Without the thesis... I'm just a tourist with too much information.”

“No,” Elías corrected her. He dared to raise his other hand and brush away a stray curl that fell across her forehead. The gesture was hesitant, yet resolute. “You're the only person in the world who knows the complete story. And I’m the only one who'll believe you. I think that makes us... partners.”

Sarah managed a half-smile, the first genuine one in days. Melancholy lingered in the depths of her dark eyes, but the panic had receded.

“Partners,” she repeated, testing the word. Its solidity appealed to her.

Outside, the storm continued to lash Santiago, scouring the stone streets clean, erasing the footprints of pilgrims and assassins alike. But inside, in the apartment’s complicit quiet, the world had ceased its dizzying spin. It had paused at that exact point of balance between two survivors.

Elías let his hand rest on her shoulder, using it discreetly to lighten the burden on his bad leg. Sarah didn’t pull away; instead, she leaned imperceptibly into him, accepting the weight.

The laptop screen went into sleep mode and winked out, plunging the room into absolute darkness, save for the orange glow of streetlights that filtered in, fluid and tremulous, through the rain.

## Chapter 38: Ultreia

CAPÍTULO: 38 - Ultreia

The wind at Cape Fisterra didn't merely blow; it shoved with the force of an unseen, colossal hand, intent on dragging everything extraneous into the Atlantic. Elías Varela felt salt crystallize on his lashes, a delicate crust blurring the horizon where sky and ocean waged their final chromatic battle.

Before them, sheltered by a rock formation that broke the northern gusts, a small, makeshift pyre sparked to life. Orange, rapacious flames licked the worn leather of the hiking boots. The rubber soles began to bubble, releasing a thick, black plume of smoke which the gale immediately scattered westward, into nothingness.

Elías watched as the fire consumed the toe of his right boot—the one that had stumbled over Compostela's cobblestones, ancient forest roots, and cathedral stone steps. He raised a hand to the bridge of his glasses, not to clean them—the reflexive motion that often betrayed his anxiety—but to secure them against the wind trying to rip them away. His fingers met the cold frame, and for the first time in years, he let it be. The lens remained grimy with salt spray, yet reality appeared with a stinging clarity.

“They say this is how you leave the old self behind,” Sarah Al-Fayed remarked.

Her voice was barely distinguishable above the ocean's roar, pounding the cliffs a hundred meters below. She sat on a slab of granite, knees drawn tight to her chest, her bare feet, pale and etched with small scars, resting on the dry moss. The wind toyed with the black curls that had escaped her braid, whipping them against her weathered face, but she made no move to brush them aside.

“Practical symbolism,” Elías countered, shifting his weight onto his left leg.

His right leg, which had borne the leaden burden of injury for weeks, responded with a mechanical stiffness. No longer did agonizing electric jolts climb his thigh, nor that feverish throb marking the seconds of his pain. Now, the sensation resembled an old hinge stripped of its oil: a dry resistance, an internal barometric pressure that alerted him to ambient humidity, but no longer kept him from standing tall. He could feel the bone's mending, a renewed internal architecture supporting his frame without collapse.

He stepped toward the fire, testing his balance. The joint held. He walked, if not with the grace of earlier days, then with an earthy solidity. His limp had reshaped itself into a rhythmic gait, a unique cadence that told his story without shouting it.

Sarah tossed a dry twig onto the blaze. Sparks danced a fleeting moment before expiring on the cold rock.

“It's not just symbolism, Elías. It's thermodynamics. Matter transforms. What we carried here no longer exists. It's smoke.”

Elías gazed at the stone marker a few meters away, emblazoned with 'Kilometer 0.00.' The end of the ancient world. The *Finis Terrae*. Beyond it lay only the liquid chasm where medieval navigation charts depicted monsters and warnings. They had walked until the land ran out. Literally.

“And now?” he asked, allowing the question to hover, unhurried.

Sarah rose. Her movements were fluid, athletic, devoid of the defensive tension that had defined her body language for months. She moved closer to the cliff's edge, where the drop was sheer and absolute.

“The sun is dying,” she pointed out.

The celestial orb, an incandescent iron sphere, began its descent into the waterline. The light shifted, turning from an aggressive gold to a melancholy violet. Their shadows stretched across the stone, elongating eastward, as if their specters sought to return to solid ground while they stared into the void.

Elías settled beside her. The astrolabe tattoo on Sarah's wrist seemed to gleam in the twilight, as though the inked lines had absorbed the solar radiation.

“In the codices,” Elías murmured, his deep voice contending with the sea's undertow, “the scribe sometimes left the last page blank. Not from want of ink, but from humility. To signify that God's work persists where man's hand concludes.”

Sarah turned her head. Her dark, almond-shaped, profound eyes caught the last flicker of the sunset. No trace remained of the academic seeking validation at dusty conferences, nor of the fugitive plotting escape routes.

“Are you suggesting we are a blank page?” she asked, a half-smile curving the corner of her lips.

“I suggest we've reached the margin. The text written by others has run its course for us.”

Elías felt an odd lightness in his chest. All his life, he had dwelled within the words of dead men, breathing the dust of parchments, measuring his worth by the exactitude of his citations. Now, facing the ocean's indifferent expanse, he grasped that history was not merely read, but enacted. The ink stain on his middle finger remained, indelible, but no longer marked his bondage to the scriptorium; it was the scar of a craft he could now choose, not endure.

The fire behind them crackled one last time, collapsing inward. The boots were ash and twisted nails.

“I won't be returning to the professorship, Sarah,” he admitted, releasing the truth that had ripened in his throat since Santiago.

She nodded, as if it were a structurally inevitable conclusion.

“I know. You don't fit there. Not anymore. Your architecture has changed.”

“And you?” He looked at her, studying her profile with the same devotion he once reserved for Mozarabic illuminated manuscripts.

Sarah inhaled deeply, filling her lungs with clean, salty air. She looked at her empty hands. No computer, no thesis, no evidence. Only skin and bone.

“The world is full of stones no one has yet listened to,” she said. “Someone will have to translate them.”

The sun vanished entirely, swallowed by the sea. The world steeped in an electric blue, that suspended moment between day and night where contours softened and blurred. Fisterra's lighthouse, perched higher on the promontory, ignited its powerful beam of light, sweeping the nascent gloom with a hypnotic rhythm.

Light. Darkness. Light.

Elías felt Sarah's presence beside him, a steady warmth in the cold wind. They didn't need to touch to know they were anchored to each other. They had survived fire, betrayal, and obsession.

“*Ultreia*,” Elías whispered. The pilgrims' greeting. *Go further*.

Sarah turned toward the path that would lead them back to the village, to dinner, to the trivial yet wondrous life of the living.

“*Et Suseia*,” she replied. “And we go higher.”

Elías cast one last glance at the ashes of his boots. Then, he turned on his heel, trusting the weight of his body to the leg that, though scarred, held him steadfast. They began to walk, allowing the Atlantic night to envelop them, not like a shroud, but like a cloak of endless possibilities.

## Chapter 39: El Nuevo Guardián

CAPÍTULO: 39 - The New Guardian

November's dampness didn't seek permission to enter the Cathedral; it simply asserted its ancient claim, seeping through the pores of Compostela granite until the archive's very air hung thick with it. A year had passed since the sky ripped open above Fisterra, but down here, among the ledgers and parchments, time wasn't gauged in months, but in the accumulated layers of dust.

Elías Varela set down his pen. The scriptorium's silence was broken only by the rhythmic drip of a distant leak and the nervous scratching of another pen, three tables away.

He removed his thick-framed spectacles, not to polish them – a habit he'd managed to curb, saving it solely for instances of genuine uncertainty – but to rub the bridge of his nose, where the acetate's weight had left two persistent red impressions. When he settled them back on, the world regained its sharp edges, and with them, the image of the new intern.

The young man, a doctoral student with too much caffeine coursing through his veins and a stalled thesis on Romanesque architecture, wasn't at his assigned post.

Elías watched from the gloom of his corner. The young man stood before the north section of the oak shelving, precisely where the ancient wood displayed a subtle discoloration—imperceptible to the untrained eye, yet glaring to anyone who knew the tale of that scar.

The young man ran his fingertips over the moldings of the auxiliary altarpiece that adorned the far wall. His dark, bright eyes scanned the surface with that specific fever Elías knew so well: the affliction of curiosity, the precursor to a discovery that shatters lives.

“Symmetry can be deceptive, can’t it?”

Elías’s voice emerged softly, a controlled baritone that barely stirred an echo in the low archway.

The intern startled, snatching his hand back as if the wood had seared him. He spun around, cheeks flushed with the mortification of being caught woolgathering.

“Professor Varela,” the young man stammered, adjusting his shirt collar. “I’m sorry, I… I was just looking at the grain. There’s an irregularity in the joinery. It seems… it seems like there was a mechanism or a cavity here before.”

Elías rose. His right leg protested with a metallic stiffness, a memory of titanium and fused bone that the Galician climate reawakened every autumn. He didn't limp, but his shuffling gait across the stone slabs had an uneven cadence, a syncopated rhythm that echoed through the room.

He walked until he stood beside the student. The young man was tall, but he seemed to shrink slightly before the chief archivist's presence.

“Wood shifts, my boy,” Elías said, lying with the truth, an art he had mastered. “It expands, contracts, breathes. Sometimes, internal stresses create voids that the human mind, always seeking patterns, construes as mysteries.”

“But twelfth-century measurements suggest this panel should be solid,” the intern insisted, with that perilous gleam of one who fancies himself cleverer than the architect. “If I tap here, it sounds hollow.”

The young man's finger indicated the precise spot. The epicenter of the tremor that had rattled Elías's life twelve months before.

Elías gazed at the boy's hand. He saw not fingers, but claws poised to pry open a Pandora's Box that no longer held hope, only shadows. He recalled the feel of paper beneath his own nails, the heft of the Codex, the blood on the stone. He thought of Sarah, safe somewhere the sun actually warmed, and grasped that his penance was not the ache in his leg, but eternal vigilance.

With paternal gentleness, Elías placed his hand on the student's shoulder, physically turning him away from the altarpiece.

“Architectural pareidolia is a snare for doctoral theses,” Elías stated, steering him back towards the work tables. “You obsess over a knot in the wood and lose sight of the forest.”

“Do you believe so?”

“I know.” Elías indicated a stack of documents at the far end of the room, beneath the steady glow of an electric lamp. “I’ve uncovered something in the capitular accounting records from 1180. A miscalculation in the purchase of wax and wine. It’s mundane, dull, and perfectly safe. It’s just what you need for your third chapter.”

The young man hesitated for a moment, his gaze drifting back to the dark panel. But the tranquil, absolute authority in Elías’s voice functioned as an anchor.

“Accounting,” the young man repeated, the thrill of discovery deflating. “Alright, Professor. Thank you.”

The intern gathered his belongings and made for the exit, his head bowed, vanquished by historical bureaucracy, yet unknowingly saved.

“Goodnight, Elías,” he said from the threshold.

“Goodnight.”

Once the oak door closed behind the young man, the scriptorium reclaimed its sepulchral quiet.

Elías waited until the young man’s footsteps faded into the outer corridor. Only then did he allow himself to release the breath he had been holding in the base of his lungs.

He turned towards the altarpiece.

The wound in the wood remained, sealed, varnished, unseen by all but him. He stepped closer and extended his right hand. His middle finger, still stained with a trace of indelible ink, traced the outline of the hidden compartment.

There was no void. He himself had filled it with resin and sawdust, sealed the fissure, rendered the hiding place a solid block. What had been inside was destroyed or moved; the official story held no consequence. What mattered was that the concealed history remained quiet.

A brief, almost imperceptible smile curved his lips. It wasn't the nervous smile of an academic seeking validation, but the serene grimace of the guardian who knows the worth of his charge. Giraldo, the mad monk, had kept the secret with fear. Elías would keep it with intellect.

Elías walked towards the archive’s main door.

He took the key ring from his pocket. The metal's weight felt reassuring. He inserted the wrought-iron key into the lock, a mechanism that groaned with the familiarity of centuries.

He turned the key. One, then two rotations.

The *clack* rang out, conclusive, like a full stop in an endless manuscript.

He extinguished the light. In the darkness, enveloped by the scent of parchment and damp stone, Elías Varela was no longer a man seeking answers. He was the answer.

The cycle hadn't broken; it had simply shifted shoulders. And his, though weary, would bear the weight.

## Chapter 40: Las Estrellas Permanecen

CAPÍTULO: 40 - The Stars Endure

Santiago’s night air carried that distinctive Atlantic dampness, a blend of distant sea salt and wet stone Elías knew intimately. Yet, on his apartment balcony, the atmosphere felt altered. Lighter.

He fine-tuned the refractor telescope's focus, an antique brass model he'd salvaged from a London auction years ago. The metal felt icy against his cheekbone. For the first time in ages, he felt no compulsion to clean his spectacles; the instrument had grown into an extension of his own myopia, sharpening the world until it became crisp, flawless.

His right leg, burdened with the physical memory of granite and brutality, chafed at the static stance. Not a sharp ache, but a geological heft, as if the bone had densified, rooting him to the earth even as his gaze sought to ascend. He shifted his weight to his left foot, easing the strain in his hip with a sigh that dissolved into the hum of the slumbering city.

“You're searching in the wrong quadrant,” a voice said behind him.

No jolt of surprise. Sarah always moved like that, a presence that stirred the air before making a sound. Elías stepped back from the eyepiece, allowing her to take his spot. A thick wool blanket draped her shoulders, concealing the loose clothing she'd begun wearing these past weeks. Her hair, freed from its usual braid, tumbled like an ink cascade over the gray fabric.

“I was trying to locate the Crab Nebula,” he explained, resting his hands on the balcony's rusted railing. The iron felt cold and abrasive. “But the light pollution is relentless.”

Sarah leaned over the instrument, her skilled fingers turning the right ascension knobs with a grace that belied the strength Elías knew they held.

“Forget the Crab. Look there.” She pointed with her index finger towards the zenith, where a milky band cleaved the heavens in two. “*Campus Stellae*. The true path.”

Elías watched her silhouette etched against the dark. The amber glow of a streetlamp picked out the astrolabe tattoo on her wrist, its black ink lines seeming to quicken with a life of their own, as if calibrated to the true constellations overhead.

“*Vega*,” Sarah murmured, her eye still pressed to the telescope. “*Deneb*. *Altair*. The Summer Triangle, still visible in autumn, refusing to depart. They are beacons, Elías. Medieval pilgrims believed that if they lost their way on earth, they needed only to mirror the sky.”

“As above, so below,” he quoted, the phrase from the *Tabula Smaragdina* slipping from his lips purely by academic muscle memory.

Sarah straightened and turned to face him. Her black, almond-shaped, profound eyes gathered the faint starlight. A fresh softness had settled in her expression, a respite from the perpetual vigilance that had marked her since he'd first known her amidst archives and death threats.

She took Elías's right hand. Her fingers brushed the indelible ink stain on his middle finger, a professional mark that all the soap in the world couldn't erase, and guided his palm to her own belly, beneath the wool and cotton.

Elías felt the warmth radiate through the fabric. His analytical mind, ever ready to catalog data and hunt for historical patterns, halted instantly. The world shrank to that curved, warm expanse beneath his hand. No scrolls to decipher here, no hidden architectural codes. Only biology, life forging its way, the future inscribing itself in real time.

“We're teaching it the stars,” Sarah whispered, covering his hand with hers, holding it captive there. “So it will know where to gaze when the ground grows unsteady.”

Elías swallowed. His throat tightened, not from the fear that often froze him in silent libraries, but from an emotion immense, oceanic. He looked at his own hand, pale and bony, resting on the genesis of a new story. No longer was he merely a guardian of the past, a custodian of dead secrets.

“I thought we'd reached the end,” he rasped, his voice a threadbare baritone. “That the archive was sealed.”

Sarah shook her head slowly, a smile almost too slight to notice curving her lips. She pressed his hand more firmly against her body.

“The path never closes, Elías. It only shifts its pilgrims.”

He nodded, grasping the absolute truth of her words. History was not a closed circle, but a spiral.

He leaned into her. The kiss carried no urgency or desperation, devoid of the survival-driven adrenaline that had defined their initial encounters. It was a covenant sealed in silence, tasting of promise and tranquility. As they parted, Elías looked heavenward once more.

Above them, heedless of human dramas, of falling empires and secrets buried deep within cathedrals, the Milky Way stretched endlessly, a river of dust and light cleaving the darkness. The stars endured, silent witnesses to what had been and to what, he now knew for certain, lay ahead.

The camera receded from the couple on the balcony, ascending higher and higher, until the city lights blurred into a mirrored firmament, and Santiago de Compostela was reduced to another glittering speck in the vastness of the night.

## Epilogue: Epílogo

CHAPTER -1: Epilogue

The air conditioning's drone was the only sound that dared profane the *Archivum Secretum's* silence. Fifty-three miles of subterranean shelving compressed the air, imbuing it with the specific gravity of twelve centuries of confessed and absolved sins.

Cardinal Visconti did not glance at his watch; in that concrete and marble bunker, time was reckoned in pontificates, not hours. He adjusted the banker's lamp on the mahogany desk, letting the green beam illuminate the sole dossier resting on the leather blotter.

The folder was slender, disappointingly insignificant for the upheaval it had contained. The label, typewritten with military exactitude, read: *Incidentia Compostellana - Operativo Finisterrae*.

Visconti turned the page with a fingertip, feeling the cheap paper's coarseness, a product of the Spanish police. Inspector Valdés' intercepted report was a masterpiece of bureaucratic fabrication. “Structural failure in the subsoil,” read the third paragraph. “Collapse managed by water infiltration and material fatigue.” Nothing of the hidden chamber behind the Portico. Nothing of the Codex. And, naturally, not a word about those who had perished defending or seeking out the heresy.

Elías Varela and Sarah Al-Fayed were listed as “external consultants evacuated with minor injuries.” The Cardinal paused at their names for a moment. They had survived. Providence possessed a macabre sense of humor, or perhaps it was simply careless. It made no difference. As long as they kept their silence, they would live. Should they speak, they would become another footnote in a different file; one not kept on shelves, but in incinerators.

He took up his fountain pen, a black resin Montblanc that felt like a scepter in his arthritic hand. He unscrewed the cap and inscribed two words in the document's lower margin, his handwriting angular and severe:

*SOLUTUS — REQUIESCAT.*

He closed the folder. The dull thud of cardboard striking wood echoed like a muted gunshot through the vast chamber. With that motion, the truth of Santiago's happenings ceased to exist for the world, becoming the exclusive domain of the Holy See.

The Cardinal rose, smoothing the folds of his cassock. His footsteps resonated across the terrazzo floor as he approached the vault's northern wall.

Here, there was no paper. This section housed not documents, but concrete evidence. A massive cabinet of reinforced steel, painted anonymous industrial gray, spanned the entire wall, stretching to where the gloom consumed its particulars.

Visconti drew a set of keys from the folds of his cincture. The metal chimed, sharp and cold. He chose an iron key, crude and antique, which sharply contrasted with the modern fixtures. He inserted it into the lock of a drawer at chest height. The mechanism yielded with a heavy click, the sound of a steel maw grudgingly opening.

He pulled the handle. The perfectly oiled bearings glided the drawer outward without resistance.

Its interior held no files, no parchments, no papal bulls.

The drawer was heaped full, overflowing with solid blackness. It was not a single fragment. It was a mineral ossuary. Dozens, perhaps hundreds, of black stones—identical to the one that had throbbed beneath Santiago Cathedral—piled upon each other like coal in a dead boiler.

Visconti gazed at the mound of irregular stones. They absorbed the chamber's light, devouring the distant lamp's green sheen. They were flakes of a dead sky, shards of the same impious matter the Church had sworn to confine. Clustered together in such abundance, they emitted a deep vibration, almost unheard by the ear, yet felt keenly in the bones; a hum that brought on a faint ache in the teeth.

There was the true Compostela. Not a tomb for an apostle, but a dumping ground for fallen stars.

The Cardinal extended a hand, barely grazing the surface of that cursed hoard. The chill emanating from the stones pierced the skin of his fingers, climbing his arm to settle in his chest. He recoiled his hand with a grimace of revulsion, as if touching diseased flesh.

He shoved the drawer shut. The steel clanged shut, concealing the blackness and resealing the radiation of that portable abyss.

Visconti stepped back and lifted his gaze, scanning the immensity of the archive wall.

His eyes, accustomed to the gloom, read the brass labels marking the other drawers, arranged in endless rows: left and right, up and down.

Beside the one he had just closed, labeled *CAMPUS STELLAE*, another tag read: *HIEROSOLYMA*.

Beneath that: *ROMA - VATICANUS*.

And beyond: *MECCA*. *VARANASI*. *TEOTIHUACAN*. *STONEHENGE*. *GIZA*.

Hundreds of drawers. Hundreds of hallowed sites.

Cardinal Visconti sighed, a sound that vanished into the vastness of the corridors. The world believed these holy places were points of connection to the divine, antennae reaching for the heavens. He, however, knew the truth. They were not antennae. They were stoppers. Heavy, consecrated seals built over the wounds where the cosmos had bled upon the Earth.

And the Church, in its boundless wisdom and its crushing burden, was the sole custodian of that cosmic graveyard.

“*Requiescat in pace*,” he whispered, not for the dead, but for the living who strode unaware upon the world's crust.

He extinguished the light. Darkness claimed the archive, and with it, the absolute silence of the stones that waited, patiently, for their next reawakening.
